I have been a resident of Khust Ashram, Anand Parbbat. A residential place set up for leprosy affected people very long back. I was born here as both my parents were leprosy affected. I am the only surviving child of my parents, my other siblings didn't survive long enough. Had an elder sister who also passed away very early. 
I studied in a hostel till class ten. Due to the death of my elder sister and a year later my mother, I had to give up school to my nieces . 
I thought life might take a turn for the better when I got married in 1994, but even that was short lived. My husband met with a serious accident, he fell off a local train and died on the spot. THis was just five months after I had my first child. 
I Had shifted to Mumbai at the age of 18 after my wedding but I was a widow at 21 with a small child to take care of. I got out and started small jobs-worked as maid, househelp, would sell vegetables, even tried home made chocolates. SOmeone told me about the work as a night healthcare aid, and I started doing that.
After some years however my father got unwell. In 2007 he also passed away and I had to shift back to Delhi to take care of my sister's children.
I shifted back to Khusht ashram. However my exposure as a night patient care assistant for people who were unwell made me realise that conditions of those living in the ashram weren't good. I had seen the problems earlier also but now it hit me more. I continued with my night patient care jobs in Delhi but during the day, I would take care of the leprosy affected patients in the Ashram. General things like getting them treatment, dressing their wounds. I did a small course of patient care and started helping people.
