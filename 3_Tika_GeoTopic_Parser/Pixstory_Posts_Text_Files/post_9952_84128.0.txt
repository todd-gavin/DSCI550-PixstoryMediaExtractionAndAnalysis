If I am to believe in you
I have to accept
You were with them
And I ask you
How did you not hear thousands of curses
How thousands of hot laid on lovers
And how you burned mothers' hearts

If it is supposed to
I believe in you
I have to accept
That you killed all the victims
You on May 13, 2020
The order to kill dozens of newborn children
You issued a plain in the maternity ward
You helped the Taliban
To take my homeland
And Kabul teenage girls
At night with the sound of airstrikes
Wish you death
So that they do not marry a cantaloupe man

If you are supposed to be
We have to ask you
How did you bring all this rubble on us?
Why did you create bisexual people?
Up in the thinking of your servants
They are neither halal nor haram

Of course
Work here that kills
Like writers and artists
You say you have nothing to do with politics
And the job of butcher dreams
And it is making contradictions
Work here that kills
They say you say
It is the fault of the people themselves
Of course you could
Abort Mullah Omar in his mother's womb
You could make Anas Haqqani a boar
In the Andes Mountains
You could beat Mullah Akhtar Mansour
Make a dogfish in the Pacific Ocean
And many stories have come from you
That you have put a dog to sleep for a thousand years
You kept a human alive in the belly of a whale
And you hid a camel in the middle of the mountain
Those who hid in the Tora Bora Mountains for years
Those who slept in the palaces of dollars and gold for years
They saw the miracles and accepted them
But a father who takes his child
In the Taliban attack
Hid in the oven
And his body
Because toast is burnt
But a mother who even has her child's bones
The Taliban tore at night
They were waiting for your miracle
