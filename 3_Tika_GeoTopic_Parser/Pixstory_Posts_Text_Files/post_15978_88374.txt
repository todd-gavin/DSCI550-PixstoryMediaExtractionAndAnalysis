Prakash Chand Negi Sanjeev Asotra Abstract Background and aims Risk factors for metabolic syndrome among obese population are not clear The role of Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA Arachidonic acid AA Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids PUFA their ratio and vitamin D deficiency as risk factors of metabolic syndrome MS was explored in obese worksite workers Methods The obese worksite workers were enrolled and MS was diagnosed using adult treatment panel III criteria The levels of EPA AA PUFA were estimated using liquid chromatography Mass Spectrometer and vitamin D levels with ELISA method The association of MS with the tertiles of EPA AA PUFAs their ratio and vitamin D was estimated by calculating odds ratio and C I taking lowest tertiles as the reference group using logistic regression model adjusted for age and gender Results out of obese worksite workers C I had metabolic syndrome The odd of MS was significantly lower in the group having highest tertiles of EPA and was higher in subjects with highest tertiles of AA EPA ratio The AA PUFA and vitamin D levels had no significant association with MS Conclusion The low levels of omega PUFA EPA and elevated ratio of AA EPA PUFA was significantly associated with MS in obese works site workers Sources
