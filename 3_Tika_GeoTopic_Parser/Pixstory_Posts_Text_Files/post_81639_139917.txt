It has been years since Arsenal s record unbeaten run came was ended at Old Trafford If you talk to a Gooner who is old enough they will still launch into a tirade about how they were short changed by inept refereeing before going on about how it was a consistent feature of the Fergie era Losing a record stretching across three separate seasons in such contentious circumstances would understandably be difficult to internalise Why does this game dubbed Battle of the Buffet continue to incense fans of old In the equivalent fixture of the previous season Ruud van Nistelrooy had squandered a gilt edged chance for United to prevent the Invincibles run by failing to convert his last minute penalty Arsenal came into the fixture as league leaders United was th with an point gap to first They had the opportunity to become the first English team to go unbeaten for games The concern for rowdy activity by players was serious enough for local police to brief the referee Two controversial decisions marred the first half The referee failed to book Rio Ferdinand for a professional foul on Freddie Ljungberg Later van Nistelrooy escaped punishment for kicking Ashley Cole on the shins he was suspended by the FA after the game In the second half Arsenal was more dominant but struggled to convert it into anything meaningful In the rd minute Rooney was fouled by Sol Campbell in the penalty box You can still find fans complaining about it being a dive The spot kick was converted by van Nistelrooy who had his score to settle United sealed it in the dying minutes via Rooney After the game tempers flared in the tunnel in presence of police officers An Arsenal player allegedly threw pizza at Sir Alex leaving players and staff shocked and disgusted Wenger tore into the referee and accused him of having decided the game He was fined for improper conduct Sir Alex referred to this day as the moment when his relationship with Wenger broke down It was not until when the rivalry itself had passed its peak that they were on speaking terms again
