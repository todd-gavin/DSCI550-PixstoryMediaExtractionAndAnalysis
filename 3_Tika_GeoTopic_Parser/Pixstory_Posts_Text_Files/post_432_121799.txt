Wore a black cotton kurta today for ABCD reasons which I have been avoiding all summer But at the end of the day I was cursing the kurta the sultry weather and the reasons So the moral of the story is throw the black kurta away and never look at it again In fact donate it Delhi doesn t deserve black Black may be my favourite Colour but I don t intend to wear it Thanks
