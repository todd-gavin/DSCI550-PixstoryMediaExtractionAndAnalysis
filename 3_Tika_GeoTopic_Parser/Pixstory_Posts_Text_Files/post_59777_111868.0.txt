Counseling is a procedure that sheds light on uncharted territory. 

Education now offers a wide range of opportunities for careers. But taking the proper route results in happiness and self-satisfaction. 

Most kids look and select their life objectives. They follow the same course after being motivated by their elder siblings, parents, or teachers. However, the world of today offers a variety of career choices and has diverse needs. A knowledgeable counsellor is needed to learn about all of these alternatives. 

Every school needs to have a pre-admission counsellor who can assess each student's cognitive talents and needs in order to direct them toward their areas of interest. 

For kids, counselling can provide new opportunities.
