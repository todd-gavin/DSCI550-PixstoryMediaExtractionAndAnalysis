Leo Messi, the 7-time Ballon d'Or winner, was recently spotted wearing the No. 10 shirt in PSG's French Cup clash against OGC Nice. 

Watching Messi wear the iconic No. 10 on his back made many fans nostalgic, but many were baffled seeing the Argentine donning the jersey as it is a number that Brazilian forward Neymar dons at the club.

Messi usually wears the No. 30 shirt at PSG but took up the No. 10 shirt because of a Coupe de France tradition. The reason that Messi wore the No. 10 shirt was because of a French Cup tradition that maintains that all the starting XI players must wear numbers from 1 to 11 in the last 16 stage.

Neymar, currently recovering from a left ankle sprain with ligament damage sustained in a Ligue 1 game against Saint-Etienne back in November, missed the game. Hence, the Argentine was assigned the No.10 shirt by PSG in honour of the Coupe de France tradition. 

Messi failed to assist or score & his performance in the game wasnâ€™t enough to inspire PSG to win the game; as they were eliminated by Nice in the Round of 16 stage.
