The fundraising starts again to help Cristina Rosi and her little Caterina On July Cristina was struck by a heart attack in the seventh month of pregnancy giving birth in extremely dangerous conditions Her husband Gabriele Succi had got in touch with Gianna Nannini to whom his wife is so fond asking for messages addressed to Cristina to help her re-establish contact with reality After almost two years Cristina woke up and for the first time she was finally able to meet Caterina for a few hours Mamma Cristina then returned to the clinic where she is continuing the therapies I don&#39;t know what will happen both have neurological problems and are not self-sufficient I can&#39;t even figure out if my wife recognizes me every time I see her She smiles she smiles at everyone and when I put Nannini&#39;s songs to her she seems to sing them by heart so it means she remembers says Gabriele Succi The family di Cristina needs support to help her return permanently to her home close to her Caterina and her husband Gabriele and continue the care she needs on a daily basis. and home care Without the help of all those who contributed to Cristina&#39;s care perhaps all this would not have even been imaginable now we need a further effort to ensure that Caterina and her mother can finally share the same roof smiling and hugging each other as tightly as in these two years it has not been possible
