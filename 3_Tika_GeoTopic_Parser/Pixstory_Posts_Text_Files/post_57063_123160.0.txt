TE doesn’t have a cure. Instead, treatment resolves around supportive measures that may include:

Speech therapy assesses and treats speech disorders and communication problems. It helps people develop skills like comprehension, clarity, voice, fluency and sound production. Speech therapy can treat childhood speech disorders or adult speech impairments caused by stroke, brain injury or other conditions.

Behavioural therapy to deal with mood changes seeks to identify and help change potentially self-destructive or unhealthy behaviours. It’s based on the idea that all behaviours are learned and that behaviours can be changed.

Memory exercises like playing memory games can also help.

Pain management therapy, including medicines, massage and acupuncture, relieves discomfort.

Medications include selective serotonin, reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors.
