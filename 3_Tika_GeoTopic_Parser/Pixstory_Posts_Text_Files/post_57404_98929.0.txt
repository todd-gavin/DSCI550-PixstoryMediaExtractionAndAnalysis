It's a never-ending fight for equality for women in every field.
Either it's about the abortion rights, equal pay or even their privacy.
Women are fettered in the squalor society has created for them.
Gender disparity is not a new term to hear, but some awful experiences made it hard to accept that despite whatever less has changed, there's still a lot left to be changed for women.

Medicine is not a field where we expect disparity irrespective of one's gender; it is about someone who is assisting people to save their lives. But Dr Deborah Keller, a colorectal surgeon at, shares how gender disparity in her profession is so lively and has not ended. 

During an operation, she faced a dilemma of whether she should continue the operation that could kill an extremely sick person or leave the patient extending his life for some more painful days at most.
When  Dr Pokala Ravi Kiran arrived, he chided Keller to stop the operation, 
“The patient is going to die. So close. What’s the issue?" vilifying her in front of other staff members and surgeons.
She says, “It would have been the same result, but it wouldn’t have been embarrassing them in front of a room full of people. I had not ever had a patient die. I just needed to know that I was doing the right thing.”
Kellar says it was not the first time she was treated that way; instead, there have been other instances too where she was humiliated this way; her boss even commented on her appearances and asked her to do duties that he wouldn't even allow other male colleagues do it at low pay.

She dealt with appalling repercussions when she raised her voice against the discrimination and ill-treatment by her boss. Deborah says her salary was halved that year; it became hard to find work afterwards.

This is just one narrative and story behind the concealed gender disparities in the medical profession, women have to deal with a lot more, and even pay gaps are a perpetual problem.
