Will You Believe Me if I tell You - I got Pizza And Peri Peri Fries in just ₹100 ??🤔🍕 

I know Nobody is gonna believe it ! But trust me It's true ! Yesterday i did A Challenge Of Having as much as Tasty food as i can have But just in ₹100 ! Firstly I was very Confused Where to go ? Because we all know getting food in just ₹100 is lil bit tough ! 🙁🍕

Luckily At my Nani's Place I got my hands on some Street food shops ! Where the price is genuinely so Low ! The first thought in my mind was if the price is low then the Quality of food must also be low ! But Nooo ! I was totally Wrong ! 🤤

You can clearly See in the picture how tasty Both the things are looking ! And Trust me , The taste was soo soo good ! Pizza Was Soo perfect ! The base , sauce and Cheese everything was perfectly Cooked ! I loved it ! And Peri Peri Fries were Wow ! I love Fries More ! 🍕🤤

Lemme be honest , my experience with This ₹100 Challenge Was Soo amazing and i loved it !! ❤️

Tell Me in notes if anyone of you have ever done Any challenge like this 💭🍕
