"Popularity is a bubble. It's a mountain: you can go up really hard but walk down really fast." "If you want to love others, I think you should love yourself first." "I've had to accept that - that everyone cannot love me. Because when there's love, there's hate. When there's light, there's dark. But it was really hard to accept as an artist that there's a lot of people that hate me, but on the other side, there are many more people who love me. I think everyone goes through that." "I’m like a surfer, first you just paddle and fall off the board but as time goes by you can stand up on the bigger waves." "Humans seem to be programmed to think of ambivalent feelings at the same time. That is the driving force behind human beings: to be the warrant of all things and to control other worlds." "We’re on some path that’s set since we’re born, but I still believe we can change some things. So I believe in my faith but I still don’t believe in my fate."
