Cricketer Shane Warne, who died in March, aged 52, was recognised with a posthumous AO for distinguished service to cricket as a player, role model and commentator, to the community through charitable initiatives, and for philanthropy.

Warne's father, Keith, said his son would have been extremely honoured to receive such an accolade.

"This award â€¦ recognises that Shane was much more than an incredible cricketer, he really was a selfless and remarkable man who always looked to support those less fortunate," Mr Warne said.

"We are so proud of him. We hope his legacy will inspire many generations to come."
