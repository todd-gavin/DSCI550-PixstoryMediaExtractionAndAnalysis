Chelsea Football Club could be making a major move this week. The London-based club are in advanced talks to sign Barcelona star Aubameyang just six months after the Gabonese striker joined the LaLiga giants.

Following the arrival of Robert Lewandowski, Barcelona are now looking to offload Aubameyang in the summer. The deal between the two clubs is said to be in the range of Â£15-25m in transfer fee. Though a final call is yet to be taken, both the clubs are said to be in advanced talks! 

As per Sky Sports, "Negotiations between Chelsea and Barcelona have been ongoing for the past few days and there is an agreement in place between Chelsea and Aubameyang."

The Gabonese striker is certainly no stranger to the Premier League. Aubameyang spent four and a half seasons with Arsenal, scoring 92 goals in 183 appearances for the North London club. The striker impressed in his short stint at Barcelona as well, scoring 13 goals in 24 appearances for the La Liga club. 

Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel is certainly no stranger to Aubameyang. The striker scored 79 goals for him in two seasons at Borussia Dortmund. Hence with Lukaku and Werner leaving the club, the Gabonese star seems to be a good answer to Chelsea's goalscoring woes this season.
