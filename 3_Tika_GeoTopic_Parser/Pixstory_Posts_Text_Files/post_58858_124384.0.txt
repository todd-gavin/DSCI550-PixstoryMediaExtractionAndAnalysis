The Supreme Court transferred FIRs filed in various states against suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma to Delhi on Wednesday in connection with her controversial remarks about Prophet Muhammad on a TV show.

All of Nupur Sharma's FIRs have been transferred to the Delhi Police for investigation.
The immunity from arrest will be maintained until the investigation is completed.

Last month, the Supreme Court ordered that "no coercive action" be taken against Sharma until the next date of hearing in connection with the complaints filed against her.
