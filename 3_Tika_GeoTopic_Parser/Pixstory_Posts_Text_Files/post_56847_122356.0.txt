Natural oils, such as coconut oil, shea butter oil, and olive oil, have been used for skin care and hair care for centuries. "Generation after generation have touted them for various moisturizing, protective, and antibacterial qualities. However, with the growth of the modern cosmetic and wellness industries, these deceptively simple substances have often been overlooked. Still, they've had a bit of a resurgence in the public eye over the last decade, as people strive to find additive-free, affordable, and effective products."

These oils are:
Olive oil
It is an excellent choice for an all-body application. You may even want to try an olive oil cleanser or bar of soap for a clean that won't dry out your skin.

Sunflower Seed Oil
Sunflower seed oil is widely available, high in vitamin E, and absorbs quickly into the skin, making it an excellent choice as a natural moisturizer.

Shea Butter
Derived from the nuts of the African shea tree, shea butter is a tallow-like substance commonly found in a solid form, but it melts at body temperature and is sometimes used as a moisturizer and hair product.

Jojoba Oil
Jojoba is native to Mexico and the American Southwest, where its oils have been extracted from its seeds and used medicinally by Native American tribes. Jojoba oil may have anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects, among other skin benefits.
