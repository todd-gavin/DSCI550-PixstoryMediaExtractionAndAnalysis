Heavy metal does not suit everyone but rock does There are certain bands that are purely rock while some straddle the line between metal and rock These groups have a harder edge and an overall heavier sound than most hard rock bands but are not heavy enough to go into the metal category For those who wish to get into hard and heavy music but do not know where to begin or those who want to jam some rock bands with a heavy hitting edge just short of metal there are many bands to start out from Some bands carry a very metal edge to their sound but mostly intentionally stay away from becoming full on metal They may have a couple of metal songs but at their core these groups are either hard rock or rock n roll and that is how they prefer to roll If you do not want a band which is pop rock and carries just enough of a punch to get you going but also is not so heavy so as to disrupt your taste then these are some of the bands you ought to hear These are groups you should hear if you want to embrace some great heavy rock music and perhaps later develop an affinity for later listening to metal If not then listen to them any way if you want some great rock music Bands you want to listen to if you want to get into heavy music and if you want some quality heavy rock Magnum Deep Purple Blue Oyster Cult Uriah Heep Rainbow Van Halen Guns N Roses Led Zeppelin Rush Queen UFO Alter Bridge Stone Sour Clutch Stone Temple Pilots
