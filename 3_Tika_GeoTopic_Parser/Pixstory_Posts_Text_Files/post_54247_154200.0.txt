If future historians pick a point in time when Australia comprehensively turned its back on coal-fired generation, they may well point to AGL’s decision to bring forward the closure of Loy Yang A, the cheapest (excluding emission costs) power generator in the energy market spanning eastern Australia.AGL announced on September 29 that Loy Yang A will close in 2035, ten years earlier than previously planned.The day before, the Queensland government announced it would decommission or repurpose all its coal generators by 2035. (It owns five of the state’s eight coal-fired plants, and has a joint-venture holding in another.)Origin Energy announced in February it would bring forward the closure of the biggest coal-fired electricity generator in New South Wales, Eraring, from 3032 to 2025.So the big coal-generation owners in the National Energy Market (which covers eastern Australia but not Western Australia and the Northern Territory) have made their intentions clear. The era of coal-fired generation is rapidly drawing to a close.The questions now are: what forms of electricity generation will replace coal, how much will it cost, and who will pay?Has coal generation been profitable?Summary answers to the first two questions are easy. The future is renewable energy, storage and more transmission. More than A$100 billion of capital expenditure will be needed.The last question (who will pay) is affected by past policy choices – particularly the privatisation of state-owned generation assets, and subsequent market regulation.Loy Yang A, along with Victoria’s other coal and gas generators, was built in the 1980s by a government corporation and sold off in the late 1990s by the Kennett government. AGL bought a one-third share in 2004, and became the sole owner in 2012.Since 1998 (the start of the National Electricity Market), I estimate Loy Yang A has produced earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) - a widely accepted measure .Read more: https://theconversation.com/the-end-of-coal-fired-power-is-in-sight-even-with-private-interests-holding-out-191951
