Captain Amarinder Singh was removed unceremoniously from post of chief minister of Punjab by Congress high command at the behest of Navjot Singh Sidhu and his hurt of being ousted is now is his main poll plank. Age is not on his side. He has aligned with BJP that carries a huge baggage of farmer stir and it hasn't made Captain's life easier. Many say he has a difficult fight at hand from Patiala constituency. 

He created the regional Punjab Lok Congress in November 2021 following his ouster and by all accounts his party at best could harm Congress's chances at few seats. 

Captain Amarinder Singh or his wife have been MLAs in Patiala, the royal seat and their home, for nearly two decades. In both 2017 and 2012, Singh won with about 70% of the vote, and his major opponents forfeited their deposits. Captain, on the other hand, does not have the Congress on his side this time.
