Jeannette Rankin is the first woman member of the U S Congress She was a feminist as well as a pacifist She was elected to the U S House of Representatives as a Republican from Montana in and again in As a lifelong pacifist she was one of House members who rejected the declaration of war on Germany in In she was the only member of Congress to vote against the declaration of war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor While in Congress she initiated legislation that ultimately became the th Constitutional Amendment granting unrestricted voting rights to women nationwide She linked the suffrage movement to pacifism She believed as did many suffragists of the period that the corruption and dysfunction of the United States government arose from the lack of women s participation At a disarmament conference during the interwar period she said The peace problem is a woman s problem Later in her life Rankin travelled the world frequently visiting India where she studied the pacifist teachings of Mahatma Gandhi Although her legacy rests almost completely on her pacifism Rankin told the Montana Constitutional Convention in that she would have preferred otherwise If I am remembered for no other act she said I want to be remembered as the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote Yes and many say have come so far but let me remind you as of Rankin is still the only woman ever elected to Congress from Montana
