In its nearly 400 year history, the classical dance form of Kerala, Kathakali had its first non hindu, artiste in Kalamandalam Hyderali. He was a renowned Kathakali Singer, and made it a popular one and unique identity without the usual dance accompanied by song. 

Last day, honourable High Court of Kerala has mentioned his name and his popular song about the conversation between Kunthi, Mother of Pandavas and Karna, the elder brother of Pandavas while giving a landmark judgement saying it is citizen's right to have  only mother's name in birth certificate and other identity documents is enough and father's name is not mandatory. 

During this judgement, honourable court has cited the mental stress and conflict experienced by Karna which is tearfully explained in Kathakali song "Enthiha Manmanasse..." played in 'Karnashapadham' attakatha. 

ഹാ ദൈവമേ 
എൻ ജന്മദാതാക്കളാരോ?
കാണുമോ ഞാൻ അവരെ?
ഒന്നു കാണുമോ ഞാൻ അവരെ?
കാണാതെ മരിക്കുവാൻ? 
ഒന്നു കാണാതെ മരിക്കുവാൻ? അവരെയൊന്ന് കാണാതെ മരിക്കുവാനാണോ 
ശിരോലിഖിതം?
