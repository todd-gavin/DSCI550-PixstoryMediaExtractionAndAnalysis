Fear of dogsI m mortally terrified of dogs The sight of a dog how so ever cute or frightening turns me into Usain BoltSomedays it s this jarring kind of fear where I don t even realise who is in front of me and all I know is that there s a dog around Most of the time someone I know becomes a human shield and honestly they re lucky if I have clipped nails
