A popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Kashmir, Sheshnag Lake is located close to Pahalgam. According to Hindu mythology, Sheshnag is a heavenly serpent, and the lake bears his name. This lake is claimed to have been dug by the serpent, who still calls it home. 
Due to its location on the holy Amarnath Caves pilgrimage path, the lake has been revered as sacred since ancient times. Sheshnag Lake is nourished by mountain streams and melting snow, although it is frozen and inaccessible during the winter. This lake is surrounded by beautiful mountains covered with snow and vast green grasslands. Brown trout fish are abundant here because this is their natural habitat.
