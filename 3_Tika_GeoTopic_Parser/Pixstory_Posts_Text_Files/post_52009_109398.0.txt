Mackenzie Hawkesby still can't quite believe she's here.

We're sitting at the headquarters of Football Australia in Sydney on a clear, crisp morning in early June. The 22-year-old is wearing a sky blue Matildas polo, still with its fold marks and fresh-from-the-box smell. The bright green logo of "Australia" catches the light as she looks out across the harbour.

She shakes her head slightly in disbelief.

"This is honestly a dream come true," she says

It's a bit of a cliché line for footballers these days, but when you listen to Hawkesby's story, you believe every word of it; you begin to understand just how powerful a dream can be.

Because Mackenzie Hawkesby's story isn't typical. Her journey doesn't go smoothly from A to B, like that of most prodigious footballers.

Instead, it's been more of a maze that has taken her mostly backwards or sideways over the course of her career.

"My story is a little bit different," she says.

"I was playing at Figtree and I was playing with the boys until I was in under-12s because we didn't have a girls' league at all [in Wollongong]. And then I moved to the Illawarra Stingrays, and from there I moved to the NSW Institute.

"I've been travelling up to Sydney my whole life. I haven't played much in the national teams; I've only been called up to the under-20s once. I was never really in the frame for anything.

"I was just playing [lower-grade] NPL [for years]. I wasn't getting game-time in first grade; I had to move to a couple of different clubs. I was struggling, I'm not gonna lie. It was tough.

"I went to the Wanderers, I was signed but I didn't play. And I've sort of just been in and around the league. I was lost. I wasn't sure if I was going to get a W-League contract again. It felt like it was all over before it really began."

By the time she was in her late teens, Hawkesby was already a footballing journeywoman, jumping from club to club with a slowly dwindling hope that she would reach the future she had always imagined for herself: representing the Matildas.
