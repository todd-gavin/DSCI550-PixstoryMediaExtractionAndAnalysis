 Developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive  have moved up the release date for their upcoming first-person horror adventure game Scorn from its previously announced date of October 21 to October 14. 
Scorn will be available on Xbox Series X|S (day one with Xbox Game Pass) and PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store and GoG). Inspired by the works of  H.R. Giger (Alien) and Zdzisław Beksiński, Scorn’s world is violently unnatural and alien, being disgusting and mysterious in equal measure. It’s visually grotesque and gets under your skin.
Scorn takes players into an isolated, strange, dream-like world. Left unguided to fend for themselves, players must explore Scorn’s interconnected bio-labyrinth, learning its rules and mastering grotesque puzzles along the way as they come to understand their own predicament.
By uncovering secrets and gathering the strange bio-mechanical tools that seem to have been used by the civilization that previously called this world home, surviving might just be possible. Finding the truth, however, is an entirely different question.
