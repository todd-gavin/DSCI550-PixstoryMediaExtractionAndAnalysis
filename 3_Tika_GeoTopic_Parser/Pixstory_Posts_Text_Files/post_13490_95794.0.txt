Human selfishness has threatened the environment. Culture building should start with smaller communities, for example, in student camps held in nature, it is necessary to acquaint children and adolescents with how to protect this blue planet and be friendly to the environment. People like students, farmers, women and mountaineers can teach others about environmental friendliness well and try to clean up the blue planet. Energy loss is only a small part of the consequences and problems of environmental pollution and waste disposal in nature. We need to know that each of us can prove our friendship with this blue planet with seemingly small activities and share this feeling with the clean earth.

So in the first stage we have to start creating culture from ourselves because even small things can make the earth can breathe. For example, by consuming less paper, we can reduce the cutting of trees, and this is what it is. On the other hand, by reducing the consumption of paper, less waste will be produced directly. Another piece of advice from environmentalists about friendship with this blue planet on clean earth is to save water because land development and plant growth depend on water. Also, by spreading the culture, it is possible to prevent the dumping of garbage in rivers, streams and waterways. Do not use nylon bags and replace cloth bags instead, pay attention to waste recycling and movement in helping this environmentally friendly movement, do social movements such as clearing mountains, rivers and forests to clean They are garbage and other measures that can be taken to protect the earth
