I can only recommend this tour Opens the soul Of course you need skis on your feet but if you are just practical with this sport then venture into this excursion in the Dolomites It is a panoramic route of about km of which to be tackled with skis on your feet And the tour of the four passes Pordoi Sella Gardena and Campolongo around the rocky massif of the Sella that crosses the Ladin valleys of Fassa Trentino Gardena Alto Adige Badia Alto Adige and Arabba Veneto Snowy slopes breathtaking views typical huts where you can eat very well sun for days a year And in summer In summer is perhaps even more beautiful but we will update in a few posts
