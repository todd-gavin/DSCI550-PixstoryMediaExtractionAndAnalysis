Drats! During a signing ceremony in Northern Ireland, King Charles III had trouble with a leaky pen, and the monarch wasn't happy about it. Oh my God, I detest this! On Tuesday, September 13, Charles, 73, cracked a joke when a pen dripped all over his hand as he signed a visitor's book at Hillsborough Castle. The king swiftly got to his feet and wiped his fingers before giving his wife the pen. Queen Consort Camilla, 75, examined the pen and said, "Oh look, it's everywhere." The king responded, "I can't tolerate this bloody thing... every stinking time," and then left the room.The sovereign was also frustrated due to initially signing the wrong date on the documents before checking with an aide who alerted him that he was a date behind.Well, a bit of an overreaction over a pen donâ€™t you think?
