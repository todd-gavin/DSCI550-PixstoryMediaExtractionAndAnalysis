Born from the encounter between the iconicity of the fabrics of the historic Italian brand with the aesthetics of the Japanese sandal, the collaboration celebrates the embrace between the respective creative visions. Declined in the Moto and Depa models, the historic zigzag and flamed Missoni patterns come to life through the unique design of Suicoke always distinguished by great creative development and the use of excellent quality materials Available in different combinations of colors and textures, the Suicoke x Missoni models are an expression of the perfect symbiosis between the strong personality of the graphics, the technicality of the materials and the uniqueness of those who wear them Purchasable starting from July, they will be available online through the two brands&#39; platforms as well as at the physical and digital points of sale of selected global retailers
