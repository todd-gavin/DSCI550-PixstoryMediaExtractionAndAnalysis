The latest Tory leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss has been canceled after the presenter fainted, live. The Sun and TalkTV debate, hosted by journalist Kate McCann, abruptly halted after she fainted.
Ms. Truss was seen looking towards the floor and ran over to where the journalist had been standing.

Julia Hartley-Brewer, the Talk TV presenter, says she has been told that Kate McCann, the Talk TV political editor who was hosting the program, is okay. There have been reports that she fainted on set, although News UK has just said there was a medical issue.

Meanwhile, on the debate, Truss and Sunak both said they support fracking if local communities are in favor. they both said they will keep the fuel duty cuts already in place. Truss said  Sunakâ€™s policies are making the UK less competitive.

If you raise corporation tax too high, you get less money into the exchequer, she said.
She said we are projected to have the lowest growth in the G7. Sunak said Sun readers are sensible enough to know that you do not get something for nothing.


So the question is - how do you pay for things? He thinks it is reasonable to ask big companies to pay more, he says.
He says he has spent his life in business. Of course, he cares about competitiveness. The key thing is to get firms to invest. So he will cut taxes for businesses that invest in the economy.
