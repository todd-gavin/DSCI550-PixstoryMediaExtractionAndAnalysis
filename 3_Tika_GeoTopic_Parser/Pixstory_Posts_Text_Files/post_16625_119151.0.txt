In January this year, Priyanka Chopra ❤️and Nick Jonas 💓welcomed a baby girl via surrogacy. 
The couple named their child Malti Marie Chopra Jonas, and they have been sharing glimpses of their daughter on Instagram and all over the internet📱📱

However, we are yet to get a clear picture of Malti Marie. PeeCee and Nick’s daughter is just six months old, and recently they even celebrated her six-month birthday by cutting a cake. 🎂🎂🥳🥳

Well, reportedly, the couple wants Malti Marie to have siblings, and they are planning more kids via surrogacy.🏥

{A source told BollywoodLife, “It’s all they’ve ever known, and their siblings are one of the most important parts of their lives so it’s something they definitely want for Malti. They’re not ready to welcome another just yet but when they do, they’re going to use a surrogate like they did last time. It’s not a matter of if, it’s only a matter of when.”}🤔🤔💭

{The source further revealed that Nick wants his kids close in age. The singer-actor also wants his kids to be close in age to his brothers Kevin Jonas and Joe Jonas. It is said that Jonas brothers want their kids to be like siblings and not cousins. Even their parents are pushing them to have as many kids as possible.}👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
