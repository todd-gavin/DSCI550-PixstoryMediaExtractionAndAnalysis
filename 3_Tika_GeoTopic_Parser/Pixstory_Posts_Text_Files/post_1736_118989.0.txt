From 1932 to 2017, Regal cinema in Connaught Place was perhaps the best known cinema hall in Delhi. 

It was built in the opera style and once one entered one reached a huge ballroom like staircase. The corridor that one passed through had posters of the films and filmstars that the cinema had once proudly screened.

All that remains now is the facade that's slowly turning into a ruin, sundry shops and kiosks and young people who pass through the corridor without perhaps the knowledge of what existed here once. The whole place has a desultory air about it.

The two broken windows that once announced the current film and the "next change" are hanging on, but only just.

One gets the impression that the owners of the cinema hall are not in any hurry to reopen it. Everything is covered in a way that suggests that no one quite knows what to do next with it. 

The neighbouring Standard bakery shop and the Standard restaurant that was upstairs are also gone, long gone.

By the look of things a comeback seems very unlikely.

But then, one never knows.
