One of the greatest pleasures in the summer is sinking your teeth into a ripe, red strawberry, or a tart and juicy peach. Summer fruits are terrific on their own, but taste amazing as a toast topping, too.

Ingredients:

Strawberry + Cream Cheese🍓🍞🧈
1 slice whole grain bread
2 tablespoons cream cheese
2 strawberries sliced

Peach + Yogurt🍑🍞🥪
1 slice whole grain bread
2 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt
1/2 peach sliced

Apple + Hummus🍎🥪🍞
1 slice whole grain bread
2 tablespoons hummus
1/2 green apple sliced

Banana + Almond Butter🍌🥪🍞
1 slice whole grain bread
2 tablespoons almond butter
1/2 banana sliced

Instructions
Toast the bread slices.
Top toast with the spread and fresh fruit.

The sweetness of the bananas balances with the nutty almond butter flavor, and it’s a great source of potassium to keep your muscles strong and maintain your body’s fluid balance on hot summer days.
