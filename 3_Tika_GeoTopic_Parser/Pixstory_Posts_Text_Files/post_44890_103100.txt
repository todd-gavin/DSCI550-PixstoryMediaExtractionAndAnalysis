Arsenal central defender Pablo Mari s transfer to Udinese has seemed to have stalled Arsenal were willing to sell the defender to Udinese after the loan spell but Udinese have put all transfer plans on hold given their uncertain managerial situation Earlier this week Udinese bid goodbye to caretaker manager Gabriel Cioff who had replaced manager Luca Gotti in December It was Cioff who looked to get Mari onboard at Udinese with the pair sharing a close relationship over their time at the club In an interview with Gazetta dello Sport Mari said When I arrived in January I had a clear and precise idea I told the coach and club owner Gino Pozzo that I was coming to play But I realised that I had to earn the job day after day workout after workout Gabriele Cioffi was the first who welcomed me well here Pablo Mari has featured times for Udinese this season averaging blocks and tackles per game He has helped the club keep clean sheets and score goals in the process as well Mari seemed all set to leave with Mikel Arteta deeming the player surplus to requirements However with Mari set to stay at Arsenal Arteta might consider using him as cover for the left center back position given that Arsenal were reportedly interested in bringing a left footed center back to the club This would help them save on money and pursue additional targets elsewhere
