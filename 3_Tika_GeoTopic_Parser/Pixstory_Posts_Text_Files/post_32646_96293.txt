The controversy over the exclusion of Daniil Medvedev Andrey Rublev and the other Russian and Belarusian tennis players from Wimbledon is mounting, all the more so because the two Russian tennis stars had immediately distanced themselves from the actions of their own government and Putin The sensible idea came precisely from Rublev that tomorrow in the semifinal of the Belgrade tournament he will challenge Fabio Fognini What we proposed at Wimbledon to at least leave us the possibility of choosing whether to play or not he explained If there was a declaration to sign forcing us to donate all the prize money to humanitarian aid to the families and children who suffer we would sign it I think such a move would really help something a figure of around one million pounds could even come out Tennis would be the first and only sport to make such a donation and it would do so through Wimbledon There that we want to be able to compete we are not here to talk politics i am russian i was born in russia i live my whole life in russia and that is why i want to show that we are good people i hope this clarified everything
