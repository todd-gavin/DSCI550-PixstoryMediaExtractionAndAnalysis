I will be a Milanesiana who travels to twenty cities but with greater roots in Milan and in many places in or less central to what happened in the last two years due to the COVID emergency, but we are proud of never having ceased to underline the importance of face-to-face meetings and of having always tried to offer them even in the most difficult moments Artists of other continents And among others there is the Russian literature of a great Russian writer Ludmila Ulitskaya who will dialogue with writers from other cultural latitudes as right and normal as she is. She wants Peace which at this moment means at least this knowing that there is an aggressor and a attacked Buona Milanesiana
