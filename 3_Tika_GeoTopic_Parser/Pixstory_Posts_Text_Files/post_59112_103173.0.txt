The new upcoming movie by Akshay Kumar has changed the movie title from Prithviraj to Samrat Prithviraj.  A week before the release date is 
June 3.

I purely think this is a move to grab the public's attention. Because there is not much difference in the title.

Whatever the movie title is, I m very excited about the movie. The main reason for it is Miss World 2017 that is Manushi Chhillar is playing the Sanyogita. Looking forward to her acting in the movie.

Of course,  Akshay Kumar the incredible actor looking forward to his performance has Prithviraj.
