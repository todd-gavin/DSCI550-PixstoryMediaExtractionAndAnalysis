Fearless women ‚Äî like they say , we all know one , raised one or are one . I really feel a certain energy when i walks into the room or somewhere fearlessly ! There is something so powerful and mysterious about a Fearless woman ! A fearless woman draws people towards her without even intending to do so . ‚ù§Ô∏è

I , you and we all Should be like this only - fearless ! 

So , to all the Fearless woman's , just wanna say ; 

1 Think Highly Of Yourself because the world takes you at your own estimate !

2 You are what you do ,  not what you say you will do .

3 This Journey Has Purpose Even If you don't see it yet .

4 Don't Be Pushed Around by the fears in your mind . Be lead by the Dreams in your heart .

5 Don't Stop Shining Just because Someone is Intimidated by your light .

6 You deserve To be Happy And Healed And Content and open , so keep going . Go realise the life you deserve !

7 Don't Be afraid Of the Solitude that comes with raising your standards .

8 No one is you and that is your power !

9 Challenges make you discover things about Yourself That you never really knew !

10 Take the risk or lose the chance !

Tell me in notes are you a fearless woman too ?? üí≠‚ù§Ô∏è
