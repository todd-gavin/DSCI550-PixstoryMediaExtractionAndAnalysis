Tujj, which is made of minced mutton and barbecued over blazing red embers using skewers, is the most delicious street food available. The greatest time to appreciate these is during the winter, and Khayam Chowk and Makai Park along the boulevard of Dal Lake is the place to do it. It is served with Lavasa, the typical bread of Kashmir, and a variety of chutneys. This yummiest street food from Kashmir is marinated with fresh spices, and left over for sometime allowing the meat to absorb the flavours. These barbecue skewers are mostly made of lamb meat also known as katt-e-maaz.
