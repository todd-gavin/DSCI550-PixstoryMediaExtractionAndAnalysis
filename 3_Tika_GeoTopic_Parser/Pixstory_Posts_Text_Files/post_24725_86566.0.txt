Incredible !!!


Along with the creative skills, he carries amazing fitness in this age. As he is completing 10 years at Madrid, after moving from Tottenham in 2012, he has been an integral part of winning the UEFA Champions League from 2014-2018 continuously, FIFA Club World Cup (2016-18), La Liga (2016-17, 2019-20). He was given the Golden ball in the 2018 Russia world cup, for the performance that led them to reach the final for the first time. He scored a similar goal against Real Sociedad a few days ago, similar to the one he scored against Argentina in the World cup. He was awarded the Ballon d'Or also in 2018. 

His path to glory wasn't easy. He was in refugee camps during his childhood and was rejected by Dinamo Zagreb when he attended trials at 10, saying too weak to become a top level competitive player. His growth was slow and steady, but was confident as he believed himself and that he only knew to play football. 

Slaven Bilic had a key role in Luka's successful career. The Croatian coach gave him an important role in the U21 and later in the Senior team. Also, he wasn't satisfied with the early big money, and stayed away from injuries. His homeland started considering Luka as a great player in recent years only as some thought he scored very less goals while some argued he plays better for the club.
