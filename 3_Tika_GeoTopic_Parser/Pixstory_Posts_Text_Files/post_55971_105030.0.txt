‌The Queen greeted the crowds from the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

‌She smiled and stood alongside Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their children.

A huge pageant has been taking place against the background of the Palace, involving 10,000 people - comprising the military, performers and key workers.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who arrived in the parade's 1990s-themed open-top bus, says she is "so honoured to be here today".

"It has been a great and amazing day... to salute the Queen who has given herself selflessly to this nation and the world and the Commonwealth."


Microsculptor Dr Willard Wigan has developed the "tiniest, biggest tribute" for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee - a microscopic model of the Queen's Gold State Coach, which she toured in for her coronation. 

A 3km-long (1.8 miles) carnival procession - starring celebrities from every decade of the Queen's reign - has been walking down London's Mall and past the Palace.

The parade's finale also featured Ed Sheeran singing the national anthem.
