If there was a penny for every time Alia Bhatt said ‘Shiva’ in Brahmastra, the audience would have left the theatres filthy rich. More than any other aspect of the film, what caught everyone’s attention was the number of times she called the protagonist by his name. It got them to an extent where social media was flooded with hilarious memes about her character. Addressing the viral trend, Ayan Mukerji revealed why did the script have so many ‘Shivas’ in it. He told NDTV, “People are making fun of it. I think when I talk, I keep taking people’s names a lot, this is my habit. So that stayed in the script and came in the film as well.” While Mukerji has a genuine take on the whole scenario, Bhatt said that she is enjoying the memes. “That’s one of my favorites. There is this one girl who imitates me, Chandni, she imitates me really well. She made an Alia Brahmastra meme where she is talking about my voice and she is outstanding,” the mommy-to-be star added. https://twitter.com/chandnimimic/status/1569313847713959936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1569313847713959936%7Ctwgr%5E91f579d2628d9b304b09822a0e0c717b30df885f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-10454129543577979813.ampproject.net%2F2208242209000%2Fframe.html
