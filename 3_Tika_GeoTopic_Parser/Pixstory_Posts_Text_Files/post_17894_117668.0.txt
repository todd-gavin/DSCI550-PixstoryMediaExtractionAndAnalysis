Brad Pitt made headlines this week for wearing a skirt to the Berlin premiere of his upcoming action flick, Bullet Train.

Just Jared has learned that the designer behind the daring look was created by New York-based Haans Nicholas Mott, who actually created all of Brad's fashionable looks for the entire Bullet Train press tour.

Haans' fashion house is a referral-only brand and the clothing is hand stitched with focus on rigorous processes over product, with outcomes determined by the individuals inhabiting the garments.

The designer says that "the intimacy of the stitching method allows for shifting and shaping through time, so that the pieces evolve and settle as they learn and acclimate to the body."

All of the hand stitching and personal detailing, which includes buttons individually hand formed by Haans' father, identify the pieces. To add to the mysteriousness of each piece, Haans purposefully doesn't add physical labels.
