I genuinely get so confused when I see vegans replicating non vegan food Like if you hate meat and dairy so much why do you want your food to look or taste like that There are tons of vegan food that is both healthy and delicious why not stick with that If meat is morally wrong in your opinion why do you want it in your life anyway Pardon my ignorance but this just doesn t make sense
