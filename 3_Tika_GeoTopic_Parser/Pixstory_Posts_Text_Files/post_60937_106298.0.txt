Don't Try. That's what written in Charles Bukowski's tombstone. In a letter when John William Corrington asked him about his creative process he said Don't try. At this stage of life I can totally understand this sentence. 

We create goals for ourselves and try to achive them throughout our whole life. We define what is success and failure for us. We can't even understand that we are continuously getting suppressed by the pressure we have created for ourselves. 

That's why Bukowski said Don't Try. It does not mean that we should compromise our all dreams and start being lazy. It means that, do what hell you want. Do it with your full heart. Whether it is good or bad does't matter. Experience everything. Learn from it. Love your hurt out. But don't set your limitation. Don't define your success. We define our success with the information we have and information is always limited. 

Don't try means don't set up your life in a particular way. 

Just live it.
