The Blues are looking to retain the services of Jorginho over the summer. But Juventus are driving a hard bargain as they look to secure the the Italian midfielder on a transfer. 

As per the Sun, Juventus have now proposed an enticing swap deal that could make the Blues rethink. The Italian giants are reportedly willing to trade Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo for Jorginho.

Jorginho's contract with Chelsea would expire in June 2023. Hence the midfielder has just over a year in his contract. But the Blues could sell him now as if the Italian does not sign an extension, they risk losing him for free in the summer. 

Having signed with the Blues in 2018, Jorginho has made 186 appearances for the European giants. The Italian is also the club's chief penalty taker and he has scored 26 goals for the London-based club. 

Jorginho has played for Serie A clubs Hellas Verona and Napoli before moving to Chelsea. His agent had earlier suggested that the midfielder has been wanting to return home after his stint with the Blues. 

Apart from Juventus, other European clubs including Barcelona, Paris-Saint Germain, Inter, AC Milan, Roma, and Napoli were also mentioned as possible options by Jorginho's agent. But a decision will be taken only after the new owners take over Chelsea in the coming months. 




Will Arthur Melo be a good replacement for the Italian?

25-year-old Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo joined Juventus from Barcelona in 2020. Since then, Arthur has played 60 games for the Serie A giants but Massimiliano Allegri has not been very content with him. 

Arthur Melo was close to signing with Arsenal in January but the move did not materialize. The midfielder is still young and developing his skills. To add to this, he has played for a couple of European giants. Hence his skill and knowledge could be very handy for Chelsea in the long run.
