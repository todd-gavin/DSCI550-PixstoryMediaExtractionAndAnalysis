The draw of the ATP Master in Montreal for the blue colors is not smiling especially for Sinner and Berrettini who need to go as far as possible to recover a penalizing ranking due to injuries and points not awarded in Wimbledon The two strongest Italian tennis players could face off already in the round of 16 Jannik Sinner, top seed, will start with a qualifier and should face another in the next round. Berrettini&#39;s road is more complicated, immediately engaged against the difficult Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta and who should then find the emerging Danish star in the round of 32 Holger Rune For whoever of the two should make it to the quarter-finals there will then in all probability be Tsitsipas Rublev or Alcaraz on the road to the title while in the upper part of the table orphaned by Rafael Nadal if Medvedev could already contend with Kyrios in the round of 32 while the other semi-finalist should be one between Ruud Norrie and Auger Aliassime all direct opponents of Sinner and Berrettini for a place in the Turin finals
