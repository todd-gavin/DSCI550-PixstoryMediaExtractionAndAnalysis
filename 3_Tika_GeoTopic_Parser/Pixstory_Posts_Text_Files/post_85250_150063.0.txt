#8 Robin van Persie
The Dutch striker made an immediate impact after joining the club in one of the cheapest transfers in history; he was one of the club's best signings. However, Van Persie had a difficult first season as a result of his actions and was benched at times. But when he was given a chance, he indicated why he is one of the most lethal strikers, thanks to Henry's injury, which provided Van Persei with an opportunity to earn Arsene Wenger's trust. He went on to score 132 goals in 278 appearances for Arsenal and climb the success ladder.
#7 Doug Lishman
Lishman joined Arsenal after an injury-plagued season in which he spent the majority of the time on the sidelines. He was brought in to replace Reg Lewis but failed to make an impact on the pitch.  Lishman, on the contrary, would score 30 goals in a season due to his goal-scoring attributes.
He would score many goals and win trophies for the club, and his disappointment would soon be forgotten as he made an enormous contribution to the club, scoring 137 goals in 244 games.
 
#6 Ted Drake
Drake, one of the most devastating forwards of the 1990s, arrived in dramatic fashion, scoring on his debut and never looking back since. He would go on to score 42 goals in 41 games in a season, becoming their best-ever striker. He once scored seven goals in a single match for Arsenal, a club record that still stands.
Drake was a classic striker who scored 139 goals in 184 games for the North Londoners. He was one of the best strikers in front of goal, whose presence gave defenders goosebumps.
