The increases in feed and energy triggered by the war in Ukraine are costing Italian farms up to 1,000 euros, also affected by the drought which burns the fodder in the fields for animal feed. And what Coldiretti affirms in expressing satisfaction with the signature by the Agricultural Policies Stefano Patuanell of the million-euro decree for livestock supply chains A measure strongly desired by Coldiretti to support companies affected by the increase in the cost of raw materials from the expensive energy and the direct and indirect consequences of the conflict in Ukraine We thank Minister Patuanelli and the Regions declares the president of Coldiretti Ettore Prandini for the joint action in favor of a sector that is worth billions of euros and represents one percent of the entire national agriculture with a significant impact also from an employment point of view where there are about thousand people at work Due to the rise in the prices of the main raw materials such as soy, corn and cereals, also due to the current crisis in Ukraine, Coldiretti explains, the price of feed has practically doubled. The result is that almost one out of ten farms is at serious risk of closure according to a Coldiretti analysis on data When a stable closes, an entire system is lost, made up of meadow animals for forage for typical cheeses and above all of people who have often been committed to fighting depopulation and degradation for entire generations, concludes the president of Coldiretti Ettore Prandini
