A suspect was charged with homicide Tuesday after being nabbed for a fatal hit-and-run crash that killed a beloved Brooklyn teacher nine months ago, police said.

Tariq Witherspoon is accused of mowing down Matthew Jensen with his Rolls-Royce as the 58-year-old teacher crossed Bayard Street near McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint shortly after midnight May 18.

Witherspoon, 30, surrendered about 8:45 a.m. at the 94th Precinct stationhouse and was charged with criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident and reckless endangerment. He was also hit with a speed violation, police said.

Jensen was crossing against traffic and Witherspoon had the green light but didn’t stay at the scene and sped off into the night, according to cops.

Medics rushed Jensen to Woodhull Hospital but he couldn’t be saved.

A teacher at Public School 110 in Greenpoint, Jensen was remembered as a top-notch instructor who wasn’t afraid to share his opinions with his students.
