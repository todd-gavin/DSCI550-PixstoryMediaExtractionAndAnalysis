Tensions were high as Liverpool took on Watford in a huge match in the Premier League title and relegation race.

Liverpool were missing their mercurial RB Alexander Arnold and Mane was also dropped to the bench. The match was an interesting one with it not being one of Liverpool's vintage performances. The Reds were 2-0 victors but won in unconvincing fashion needing a late penalty to seal the match beyond doubt.

Before the penalty in the first half Diogo Jota put Liverpool ahead with a classy header when Joe Gomez who was the deputising RB delieverd a great ball into the box. Moments before this goal Watford had a chance of their own which went begging.

The second half wasn't much better from both sides with both sides struggling to muster any good chances. However Watford had one big chance which they again missed as Joao Pedro put the ball wide of Allison.

The man of the match for me was Thiago as he was running the game from midfield and controlling the whole tempo of the match. The Spanish midfielder played some exquisite passes and his performance was one of the highlights in a poor showing by the Merseyside outfit.

With the win Liverpool at least at the time of writing this article go to the top of the Premier league table with Man City going up against Burnley. Liverpool's next match is against Man City and for me it is the match that will decide who will be the kings of England this time around.
