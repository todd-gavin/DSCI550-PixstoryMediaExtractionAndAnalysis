Yesterday, Ameesha took to the ‘instagram and shared the photo in question. In the picture, one can see Aishwarya and Ameesha seated beside each other at an event. While Aishwarya looked striking in a beautiful printed outfit. Her hair was left open and she had bronzed makeup look with brown lipstick. On the other hand, Ameesha was seen wearing a beautiful yellow salwar suit. She too kept her hair open while she rocked a crimped look. Both the actresses can be seen breaking into a laugh in the photo. 😍😂❤️‍🔥

Sharing the snapshot, Ameesha wrote in the caption, “Hey guys .. as promised the THROWBACK WEEKENDS that I started last week upon so many requests..So here goes …The beautiful aishwaryaraibachchan_arb n me as chief guests at a show cracking up on some silly joke we had cracked and we cud not stop the laughter ❤️😍😍
