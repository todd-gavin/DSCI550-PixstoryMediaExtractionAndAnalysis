Searching for increasing violence among youth let's not forget about how video games become an influence on the youth. Aggressive video games affect the behaviour of children at times in a very negative way. The topic of violent video games promotes comes dates back to debate 1976 release of the game Death Race. The objective of the game was to run over screaming “gremlins” with a car, at which point they would turn into tombstones. Controversy flared because the “gremlins” resembled stick-figure humans, and it was reported that the working title of the game was Pedestrian.
 After protestors dragged Death Race machines out of arcades and burned them in parking lots, production of the game ceased-which I agree is also a very harsh thing to do, for one who claims to be a protester against violence.

These and many other events lead to the creation of a rating system in 1994. Based on the video game’s content, the ESRB assigns one of the following ratings: “Early Childhood,” “Everyone,” “Everyone 10+,” “Teen,” “Mature,” “Adults Only,” or “Rating Pending”. But this is often ignored by the teens as well as their parents.

Let's not forget about the massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in Jefferson County, CO, on Apr. 20, 1999. The two teenage shooters were disclosed to be avid players of weapon-based combat games Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Following the shooting, 176 newspaper articles across the country concentrated on the allegation that video games were the cause of the tragedy. 

 Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying, and fighting. The division of games in the name of gender is slowly changing-promotes toxic masculinity. 

Various peer-reviewed studies have indicated that children who play M-rated games are more likely to bully and cyberbully their peers, get into physical fights, be hostile, argue with teachers, and show aggression towards their peers.
