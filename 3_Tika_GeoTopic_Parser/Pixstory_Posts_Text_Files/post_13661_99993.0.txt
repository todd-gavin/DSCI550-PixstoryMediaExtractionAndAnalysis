The former US National Security Adviser says the military advance of the Resistance Front is encouraging and called on the Taliban opposition to provide more support for the resistance in Afghanistan by occupying more areas.
 In an interview, Donald Trump, a former national security adviser, described the Taliban's denial of the military's military achievements as a propaganda move.

He added that capturing more areas is more important to the Resistance Front and other Taliban opponents than influencing public opinion and international policymakers.

 "There is considerable support for the resistance in Congress. But for those who support them there, it is important to see that this front has really increased its capabilities. They want to make sure their money is not wasted. Congress has allocated millions of dollars to Ukraine. "Therefore, show in practice that there is a real resistance in Afghanistan as well."

 Criticizing the Biden administration, which said the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan was a "strategic mistake," the United States must absolutely support the resistance. Subsequent governments in Washington are likely to support resistance against the Taliban.
