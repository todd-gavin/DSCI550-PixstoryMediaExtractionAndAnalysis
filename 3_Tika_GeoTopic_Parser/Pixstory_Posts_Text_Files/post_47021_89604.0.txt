Set oven and prep pans. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a couple of sheet pans with parchment paper and set them aside.

Make the batter. Add the butter, both sugars and salt to a large mixing bowl. Mix just until it's smooth. Then stir in the cooled coffee mixture. Once it's blended in, add the egg and mix to blend. Fold in about half the flour and baking powder. Add the remaining half of the flour with the chocolate chips and stir only until you no longer see dry spots.

Shape. Use a 1½ inch cookie scoop to shape balls of dough, placing them on the parchment-lined baking sheet as you go, with a couple of inches between them.

Bake and cool. Place the pans in the preheated 350°F and bake for approximately 10 to 12 minutes..

Your 🍫 chochip cookies are ready 😋
