The omicron variant is more contagious than delta, but so far it has been quite mild for majority of patients. Some have even speculated it might be a kind of natural vaccine, with which the coronavirus might spread to cover sufficient people, induce herd immunity and finally end Covid-19. Given its mild symptoms (and ‘precaution fatigue’), some are either not taking enough care, or even wonder if it’s not a bad idea to get infected and done with it. It’s a bad idea.

The counter-intuitive logic is: If one is going to get the infection, this may not be a bad time since symptoms are mild, and also one would develop antibodies which would protect against any future waves – at least for a while.

The ‘natural vaccine’ theory has also been doing rounds in some places, but experts have dismissed the claim: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-omicron-act-as-natural-vaccine-experts-weigh-in/articleshow/88756578.cms and https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-acts-as-natural-vaccine-experts-say-notion-rooted-in-pandemic-fatigue-101641107770257.html

The trouble is, omicron is as deadly as any other variant, with severe symptoms, for people with co-morbidities and other vulnerabilities. Plus, also consider:

* Hospitalizations numbers are rising, and one should rather not add to the immense pressure under which the public healthcare system is trying to work. Resources are under unprecedented strain.

* You may be a healthy person without any vulnerability and may end up with only mild symptoms (especially if you are vaccinated), but you will add up continuing the virus chain, passing it on to others, some of whom may be at higher risk. If one person makes all attempts to protect oneself, there’s a little bit higher chance of breaking the chain.

* If omicron continues to gain currency, it can lead to further mutation of the virus and future editions may not be so ‘benign’: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/pfizer-ceo-says-omicron-appears-milder-but-spreads-faster-and-could-lead-to-more-mutations.html 

* The term ‘mild’ is misleading. There’s bad cold, about a week of fever, congestion, sore throat and lingering fatigue. It’d keep the whole family in isolation. One doesn’t know its long-term aftereffects.

* As for getting protection against the next variant, better to keep faith in the more effective treatment and vaccines coming up soon. Scientists are working in that direction.
