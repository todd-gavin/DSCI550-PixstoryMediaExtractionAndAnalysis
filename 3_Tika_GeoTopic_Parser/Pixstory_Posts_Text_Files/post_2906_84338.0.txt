US senators and officials in Ohio, Utah and New Hampshire appealed to all liquor stores in their 
respective states and the US to remove Russian products from shelves in protest of Russia’s Ukraine invasion. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, went on to the extent of asking people to “Dump all the Russian vodka” along with all ammunition  from Russia, and despatch emptied Vodka bottles to Ukraine for “use as Molotov cocktails”.    

Such emotional calls for boycotts during war or conflicts is nothing new, which reminds of a similar call by a US politician to ban French products in 2003 when France opposed the US plan to invade Iraq in 2003. Some restaurants even renamed French fries as “Freedom Fries”.

But, such calls for boycott serve only a symbolic purpose with little effect on the "enemy" or its economy. Most of the Vodka brands with their Russian sounding names are actually distilled in various countries, including the US. For instance, Stoli Vodka has nothing to do with Russia except its name – which means “capital city” in Russian -- because it originated in Moscow. Stoli is manufactured in Latvia and the company is based at Luxembourg, a NATO member in Europe. The owner of the brand and the country have strongly opposed Putin’s Ukraine aggression. Vodka brand Smirnoff is owned by a British spirit company; in the US it's distilled in Illinois.    

A little less than 1% of vodka consumed in the US is manufactured or bottled in Russia. There are only two prominent brands, Russian Standard and Ustianochka, that are owned or produced in Russia. Russian Standard is owned by Roustam Tariko, a Russian oligarch. More than half of vodka consumed in the US is actually domestically produced.  

France accounts for the maximum import value of vodka in the US (39%), its brands include Grey Goose, Gallant and MontBlanc. Sweden is next with 18%, with its best-selling brands like Absolut and DQ.  Netherlands (17%), Latvia (10%) and Poland (5%) follow Sweden. 

In essence, boycotting "Russian" vodka won't affect Russia, but leave an impact on the economy of the US, or its allies.
