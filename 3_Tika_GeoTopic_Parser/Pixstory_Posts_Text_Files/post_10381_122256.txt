Cardiology in Mantua directed by Corrado Lettieri is increasingly at the forefront in Italy for the minimally invasive treatment of heart valve diseases. of the structure coordinated by Michele Romano, procedures for the percutaneous treatment of tricuspid valve insufficiency and degenerated surgical prostheses in the mitral position have recently been performed by a multidisciplinary team For the percutaneous repair of the tricuspid, the Carlo Poma Hospital among the hospitals in Lombardy of which only two are who perform this type of innovative procedure What it consists of A small hole is made in the femoral vein and unlike traditional cardiac surgery, it is not necessary to open the chest and extracorporeal circulation The valve is repaired by applying it to the valve flaps under fluoroscopic guidance and above all transesophageal echocardiography of small metal clips which increase the tightness of the valve itself, significantly reducing its insufficiency Similarly, again through the femoral percutaneous venous access, transcatheter valve implantation was performed to treat the degeneration of biological surgical prostheses in the mitral position. The procedures in question allow us to further expand the range of heart valve pathologies that can be effectively treated percutaneously and to make the operation safer especially in patients who, due to age or comorbidity, present an increased risk in the case of traditional cardiac surgery. The multidisciplinary team involved is made up of interventional cardiologists, ultrasound cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and anesthesiologists
