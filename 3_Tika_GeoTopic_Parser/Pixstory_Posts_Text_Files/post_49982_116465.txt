The Bean Eaters BY GWENDOLYN BROOKS They eat beans mostly this old yellow pair Dinner is a casual affair Plain chipware on a plain and creaking wood Tin flatware Two who are Mostly Good Two who have lived their day But keep on putting on their clothes And putting things away And remembering Remembering with twinklings and twinges As they lean over the beans in their rented back room that is full of beads and receipts and dolls and cloths tobacco crumbs vases and fringes The three stanzas of The Bean Eaters take the reader into the lives of an older couple who are expending their last days alone together eating beans The beans are only one way in which Brooks portrays their poverty in the text They can t afford much making do with the shattered plates and old furniture they have in their rented room The two drift into the background at the end of the poem as the speaker focuses on their insufficient belongings They are forgotten by the reader just as they ve been forgotten by everyone else
