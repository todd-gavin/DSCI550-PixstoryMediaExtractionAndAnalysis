Argententian forward Sergio Aguero is sure that Lionel Messi will thrive in France, after a difficult first season for the former Barcelona man. Messi scored 11 goals and provided 14 assists for his teammates. While those numbers would be a stellar campaign for any other player, it fails to capture expectations at the start of the season when Messi had joined PSG to much fanfare. 

Aguero, backing his former Barcelona and Argentina teammate said, “It's still his first year and, having to adapt to a different league, his performance has been very good.
Leaving the Champions League aside, they won the league comfortably. PSG is full of elite players and Leo is a winner. I'm sure his second season will be even better.”

Aguero believes in Messi that he will spark into life in his second season at Paris, bringing the club the elusive Champions League trophy that they have spent chasing for so long. 

Talking about his own first season on Instagram, Lionel Messi posted, “The season is over and I wanted to thank my team-mates for how they treated me since I arrived and my family for always accompanying me and supporting me.
It was a different year because of everything that happened, but at the end of it all we won a title that I was very excited to achieve because of what it means to have a first trophy here in Paris.
Surely good things are coming in 2022, it will be an important year and we are going to fight to be competing with ambition for everything.
See you later!”

Everyone will be hoping for the little magician to kick on and perform at the heights we’ve been accustomed to see Messi perform at.
