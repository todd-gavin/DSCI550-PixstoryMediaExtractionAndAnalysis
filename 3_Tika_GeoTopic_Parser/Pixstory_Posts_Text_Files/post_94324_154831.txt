Team India suffered a humiliating defeat against the USA in their opening match of the FIFA U Women s World Cup This was a big blow for the hosts as they have already been placed in a very difficult Group alongside USA Brazil and Morocco During the post match press conference India s manager Thomas Dennerby opened up about some big mistakes that they committed during the match For instance he was surprised by how easily some of the USA corners totally opened their defence up The funny thing is that for a very very long time we did not let any goal in from almost any set piece at all We have been defending very very well but of course we have not played against any team with top quality players like this who has ft height also jumping very high and heading with top class quality Honestly I was a little bit surprised because we used to be very sharp in set pieces But of course that was not the case today The gaffer also cited nervousness as one of the many reasons for their loss tonight I know that team India can play a little bit better than this My feeling from the side was that girls were little bit too nervous Couldn t really handle the pressure of playing their first world cup So in the beginning we didn t even try to pass the ball to each other we were just defending and sending it away not comfortable enough I was shouting from the sideline Start playing start playing and the first time we tried to build up we lost the ball and that was On being asked whether this was his biggest ever defeat he replied that he hadn t lost a game by margin in a championship match before He said that he did not expect India to let so many goals in before adding that even against Sweden a week ago we defended very well
