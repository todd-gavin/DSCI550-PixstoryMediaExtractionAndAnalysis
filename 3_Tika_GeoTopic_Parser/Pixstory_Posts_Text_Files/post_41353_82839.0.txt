According to Fox News, security officials will erect fencing around the Capitol next week, ahead of President Biden's State of the Union address. 

The US Capitol Police are preparing for a possible "Freedom Convoy" truck protest on March 1 in Washington, D.C. Truckers from the "Freedom Convoy" have been protesting coronavirus restrictions and vaccine mandates in Canada for weeks, causing a temporary blockade of the key Ambassador Bridge border crossing between Windsor and Detroit.

Capitol Police say they're "aware" of similar protests coming to Washington, D.C., and they're planning to "facilitate" First Amendment protests while also working with law enforcement and the D.C. National Guard to prepare for Biden's speech. 

â€œThe United States Capitol Police and the United States Secret Service have been closely working together to plan for the upcoming State of the Union," the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement Friday. 

The National Capital Region's law enforcement agencies are aware of plans for a series of truck convoys to arrive in Washington, DC around the time of the State of the Union address, police said. "The USCP, like with any demonstration, will assist lawful First Amendment activities."

Following the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the Capitol grounds were heavily fenced, policed, and surrounded by military personnel.
