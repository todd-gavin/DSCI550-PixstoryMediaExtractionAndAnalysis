Rahul Gandhi took aim at the BJP today, highlighting the murder of 19-year-old Ankita Bhandari in Uttarakhand, which shocked and outraged the nation. He claimed that the incident was an illustration of the BJP's treatment of women as "second class citizens." "The ideology of the BJP is true in this regard. Power is the only thing they respect "said he.
Ankita Bhandari was allegedly murdered by Pulkit Arya and two of his accomplices for refusing to offer "special services" to visitors. Pulkit Arya is the son of a BJP leader who has since been expelled. On September 24, her body was recovered from the Chilla canal close to Rishikesh.
