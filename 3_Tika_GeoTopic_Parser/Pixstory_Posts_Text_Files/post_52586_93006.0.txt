You will score major creativity points and have an unforgettable experience to boot. (You can thank us later!)

For those couples who love the outdoors, grab a bicycle or a pair of good running shoes and head to the C & O Canal National Historic Park. Check out the lock houses which some allow lodging and go for a romantic canal boat ride.

If you are looking for incredible views, climb into a gondola and take a spin on the Capital Wheel or set up a picnic on the National Mall with the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument as your backdrop.

Does your significant other like the arts? Get them tickets to a show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The venue's calendar regularly features internationally-known artists from a wide range of fields including music, ballet and opera.

Another great spot is the National Gallery of Art. Step inside to see world-famous pieces from artists like Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock. During winter months, lace up a pair of ice skates and hold your lover's hand to take a spin on the museum's ice rink located in the garden. You'll get a great shot for social media standing in front of Robert Indiana's AMOR sculpture outside in the garden.
