Following a visit to Caracas by a high-level team from Washington, DC, Venezuela has released two imprisoned US nationals in an apparent goodwill gesture. 

Gustavo Cardenas was one of the prisoners released on Tuesday. He was one of six Citgo oil executives arrested in 2017 and convicted on fabricated corruption charges, according to the US government. 

The other was Jorge Alberto Fernandez, a Cuban-American imprisoned on unrelated charges. 

In a statement, US President Joe Biden said, "Tonight, two Americans who were wrongly incarcerated in Venezuela will be free to hug their families once more." 

He said, "We're bringing Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Fernandez home." He didn't say anything else concerning their release.

Cardenas and Fernandez arrived in the United States on Wednesday, according to the US Department of State. 

AlJazeera reported that their release came just hours after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro expressed interest in repairing relations at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised concerns in the United States about rising gasoline costs. 

He appeared to hint in a televised address that he was willing to acquiesce to US demands that he resume conversations with his adversaries as a first step for any respite from US sanctions that have been hurting the OPEC nation for years.

In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, "We welcome the release of US citizens Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Alberto, both of whom had been wrongfully held in Venezuela."
