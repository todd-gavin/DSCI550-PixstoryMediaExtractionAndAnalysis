I have been visiting Bodh Gaya on several occasions since and my understanding of the place and its importance has been increasing after every visit Bodh Gaya today is an international tourist destination visited by tourists from across the Globe The site appeals to one and all with the message of universal peace The Mahabodhi Temple Complex today is a World Heritage Site as declared by the UNESCO A lay tourist visiting Bodh Gaya generally develops the feeling that the site was preserved in the earlier times in the same manner as it is seen today It may appear very strange if the tourist is made to understand that just about two centuries earlier a tourist visiting Bodh Gaya was not even aware about the existence or importance of the Mahabodhi temple or about the sacred and historically revered Bodhi Tree When Francis Buchanan had visited the site in he found no mention of any importance of the Buddha at the very place of his enlightenment Even though the place was called Bodh Gaya the significance of the site in history was only vaguely understood The local populace was totally unaware of the story and the legends of the Buddha s existence at the site It was only in the later part of the th century that Bodh Gaya could be rediscovered In fact the credit for the rediscovery of Bodh Gaya on the tourist map largely go to the excavations carried out at the site during British rule and to the reconstruction of the ruins under Cunningham in the second half of the nineteenth century The Mahabodhi temple as seen today is the result of thorough repair and restoration work carried out by Cunningham and Beglar in under the orders of Sir Ashley Eden the then Lieutenant Governor of Bengal The Management of the Temple was removed from the Math after independence and is handed over to a committee as per the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee Act The site remains as a tribute to the ancient glory of the Buddha and to his important place in the history of mankind To be continued
