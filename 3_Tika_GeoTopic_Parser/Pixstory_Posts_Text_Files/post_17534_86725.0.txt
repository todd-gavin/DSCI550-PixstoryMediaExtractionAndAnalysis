According to the NBA's injury report, LeBron James is listed as "questionable" with knee soreness ahead of the game against the Wizards on Friday night. The Lakers captain has been managing the injury for a while, saying that only rest will help him return to full health.

Unfortunately for James, the four-time NBA champ does not have that luxury, as he gives the Lakers their best chance of staying in the top 10.

It is unclear whether James will suit up as he is a game-time decision. He played 39 minutes in the 124-116 win against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. But then he was left out of the lineup for the next game against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.

Things did not get any easier for LBJ, who had to play 45 minutes in the 139-130 overtime loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. There is a chance he might be sidelined to avoid overstressing the knee and risking long-term injury.
