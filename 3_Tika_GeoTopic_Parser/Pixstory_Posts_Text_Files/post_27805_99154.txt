The away win against Spezia allows Atalanta to remain in the running for a placement in Europe but does not dispel the clouds over Gian Piero Gasperini&#39;s future at the helm of the Nerazzurri In the press conference after the match at the Picchio, the Piedmontese coach in fact left it open the question about next season despite a contract that binds him to the Bergamo club until It seems that finishing sixth he explained is a failure It seems to me a bit of a distortion of thought If Atalanta can win something an Italian Cup and it would still be a feat I signed a clear contract that things have changed a bit a lot depends on what the club decides but if it goes ahead it will do it with the utmost enthusiasm Photo Instagram atalantabc
