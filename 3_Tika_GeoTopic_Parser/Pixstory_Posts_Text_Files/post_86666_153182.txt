Money hiest the best TV show I ve watched so far it deals with mind games and strategies which makes you awestruck If you re an amient fan of robbiers and like watching heists then this is a must watch You ll never feel bored while binging on it I would definitely recommend you to watch it and it ll leave you with the best experience It gets better and better and BETTER It is a very well made show with writing at its peak the character development is fantastically detailed and yet so subtle because you wont get to know their real names The twists are epic the plots are believable and the acting of the heist gang members is so REAL The strategies and Plans used by Professor gave me multiple goosebumps The best part of Money heist is that the Professor has everything worked out beforehand Whenever the gang members face any situation the scene goes back to the classroom where Professor explains on what can be done Nobody could have played the better Professor And you will fall in love with each and every character nbsp I just love Berlin He is the mastermind and he s theory and thoughts will make fall in love with him And when he said i will die with dignity you will love him He is an art And ofcourse our beloved Professor nbsp He is just awesome throughout Its execution is so good and the writer has well played with user s mind that you will hate all each and every person automatically who try to intervene or stop them in the execution of their plans Even though you know they are the robbers but still you will pity them you will feel for them This is what the writer wanted The Writer has done the amazing job Hats off Money Heist subtly places brilliant music in every season Be it Bella Ciao or Maria in the previous seasons And won everybody s nbsp heart And I nbsp am in love with Tokyo and Professor Period Let me know how helpful it was
