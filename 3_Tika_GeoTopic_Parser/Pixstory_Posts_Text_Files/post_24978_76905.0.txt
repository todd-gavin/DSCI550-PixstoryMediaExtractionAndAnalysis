On a daily basis we saw sign of improvement as Nauman responded day by day for the to new words, sounds. He started knowing names of colours. It was a huge relief as I felt the implanted cochlear device was working well. 
Dr Ursila also gave special techniques to my wife to go with the new hearing methods so that his vocabulary will improve day by day and major thrust was given on the difficulties being faced by him in spoken words and at this time his voice struck on one or two words.
Day by day, his word world becomes bigger . He is familiar with all the words, colours, speaking words, animals. Witj
joint exercise by Doctor Ursila Bashir and my wife, now Mohammad Numaan is able to learn and write very well like a normal kid of his age. 
He still gets stuck with some words  we are
doing regular practice to him out. 
After one years of hectic and continuous speech therapies, he is able to understand the words, colours and trying to differentiate vowel words as well and got admission as a normal kid in Legends Public School, Sadrebal, Hazratbal, Srinagar for LKG class in 2021 .There are new challenges of life and to cherish the atmosphere of schooling as well but lockdown -2 affected him a lot.
Everyday in the morning, his mother is checking the gmail account about the schedule of the UKG class during the day time and he enjoying studying through laptop and mobile phone with the zoom classes to compete with other normal kids of the class.
He is doing good . We seek all your blessings for him in the future also.
