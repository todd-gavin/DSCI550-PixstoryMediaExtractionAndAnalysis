When your mother makes your favourite Swiss roll, it gives you a different vibe. 

My mom made my favourite Swiss roll with Afghan green tea when I woke up today. Although it appears to be black tea, it is actually green tea. 

I am fortunate to live in a shelter with a generous family who makes me feel safe and fortunate.
