On this Independence Day we will once more proudly raise the tricolour remember the heroic martyrs wear tricolour clothing and sit down in front of the television to watch the festivities Do we ever consider the gift of independence we were given in the midst of all these activities This is a question I ve thought about a lot so today on independence day i decided to write it down There are definitely feelings associated with this day Independence in my opinion is the ability to express oneself freely and to use that ability to advance knowledge and experience of daily life Freedom to me is independence Freedom that does not detach us from our ideals but instead satisfies our desire to grow as individuals Independence to me is about experiencing life to the fullest To have fun and strive to be your best each and every day of your life It involves taking a brave and powerful stance Independence to me means living a life and taking ownership of our actions Yes becoming independent comes with horrifying responsibilities Independence entails taking responsibility for my actions and making my own decisions The power of creativity is independence Happy Independence Day Everyone
