Arsenal have been one of the overachievers of the season The Gunners started their season with three losses and were languishing at the bottom of the table However Mikel Arteta backed his younger players as they made a charge towards a top four finish However despite their best efforts Arsenal might just lose out on UCL spot after their away loss to Newcastle United Arsenal will host Everton for their final fixture of the season and must ensure a win to remain in the hunt for a top four finish They must hope that their North London rivals Spurs lose on their away trip to Norwich if they are to make it to the top four Nevertheless Mikel Arteta remained optimistic and stated that irrespective of the ending this season will still be a success Arsenal fielded one of the youngest sides in Premier League this season as Mikel Arteta stated that they have achieved what no team in the last years have They have shown they have what it takes because what they have done in the last ten seasons nobody has done it A club with that age bracket in the starting XI on the pitch it hasn t been done in this league said Arteta before the home fixture against Everton The Gunners boss gives the entire credit to the Arsenal squad who have stepped up for their side this season However Artrta admits that Arsenal are still miles off from being the best team in the country and it is still a long process The thing is where we want to be is not where we are today We want to be the best but that gap is still really big Arteta added Irrespective of the result on Sunday Arsenal will at least make a return to European football If Arsenal win their fixture and if Spurs are defeated by Norwich then Arteta s men will book a UCL spot
