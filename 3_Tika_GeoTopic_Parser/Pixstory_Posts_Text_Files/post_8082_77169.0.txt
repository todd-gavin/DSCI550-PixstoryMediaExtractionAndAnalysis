Dozens of women held a protest in Kabul on Wednesday over the Afghan central bank assets frozen abroad. The demonstration comes amid severe economic and financial challenges in Afghanistan.

The protesters also called for the international community to recognize the Islamic Emirate.

The protesters also called on Afghanistan’s neighboring countries not to intervene in Afghanistan’s internal affairs.

At the end of their protest they read their demands and called on the international community and international organizations, particularly the World Health Organization, not to leave Afghanistan alone at this difficult time.

“The international community should recognize the Islamic Emirate. The US should release Afghan money immediately. The international community and Afghanistan’s neighbors should not intervene in Afghanistan’s internal affairs,” said Basira Didar, a protester.

“The money belongs to the people of Afghanistan, and it should be released because the people of Afghanistan are in a bad situation,” said Hafiza Amiri, a protester.

The women protesters also called for women to honor the Islamic hijab.

“We do not wear hijab because of the Taliban or other people. We wear hijab because God has said to wear it and there is honor in wearing hijab,” Fatima, a protester said.

Following the collapse of the previous government last year, over $9 billion assets of Afghanistan’s central bank were frozen in banks abroad, mainly in the US.

With the assets remaining frozen and the international support to development projects halted, Afghanistan now faces severe economic and humanitarian challenges.
