My dietitian is going to kill me While she asked me to stay off salt to throw the water my body has been retaining out I binged on my comfort food For me it s Chinese anyway That gooey schezwan sauce and moist chicken lots of soya and chilli sauce Uff my day is made and now time to pop a pill for allergies Yes your Chinese food is full of gluten which comes from both soya sauce and corn starch But sometimes it is what it is So Chinese it was today
