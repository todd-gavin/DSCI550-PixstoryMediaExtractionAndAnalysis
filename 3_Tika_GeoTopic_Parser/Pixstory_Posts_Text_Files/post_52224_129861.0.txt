Overfishing has not only thrown the marine ecosystem out of balance, but it has also managed to cut the total fish population in half compared to 1970 â€“ that was only 50 years ago.

The demand for tuna and mackerel in particular has become unsustainable, and the two species are currently at the brink of extinction. Going vegan allows marine life to thrive again, repopulating our oceans and replenishing our seas.
