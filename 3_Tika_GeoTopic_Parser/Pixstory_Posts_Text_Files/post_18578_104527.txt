From the European Championship onwards, the decline of the national team has been constant and two days ago in the Final against Argentina perhaps the lowest point of Mancini&#39;s management was reached both for the result but above all in terms of the game A team without ideas at the mercy of the opponents And all in the stadium of the Cup raised in front of England It seems like a lifetime ago Here therefore that for the umpteenth time there is talk of starting a new cycle with new faces always at the helm of the same coach There are rumors that are starting to circulate and that they would see a good new national team only in the face of a coach other than Mancini such as De Zerbi currently under contract with Sachtar but in reality stopped for months due to the war that broke out in Ukraine and all the championships suspended Perhaps for Mancini he still has an opportunity to rekindle the hopes Tomorrow evening the Nations League will start for Italy and although it won&#39;t be easy matches the coach could convince them to continue with his management Saturday June the opponent in Bologna will be Germany Tuesday June in Cesena the Azzurri will play against Hungary challenge England in Wolverhampton Saturday June and finally again against Germany but away in June
