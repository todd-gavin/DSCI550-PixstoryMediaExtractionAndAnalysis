Machoi Peak is a mountain in the Ganderbal region of Indian-administered Kashmir, close to Sonamarg, with a peak elevation of 17,907 feet (5,458 metres). Located halfway between Amarnath cave and Zojila, Machoi Peak is a mountain in the Himalaya Range. It is located 25 kilometres east of Sonamarg and 105 kilometres north of Srinagar. It emerges from the glacier that bears its name, Machoi Glacier, which is where Nallah Sindh originates close to Kashmir Valley. From the Machoi Glacier, Machoi Summit rises as a pyramid-shaped peak with ridges, ice falls, and ice fields at its base. A British medical team led by Dr. Ernest Neve conducted the first reconnaissance of Machoi Peak in 1912, but they did not climb it. On September 10, 1984, an Indian army crew successfully climbed it. Starting from Baltal, a 20-kilometer high-altitude alpine tract leads to the foothills of Mechoi Peak. This is the quickest and easiest way to reach the peak's west face. It is difficult to cross the entire Machoi glacier with its ridges and falling ice from the north side due to the steep terrain. Due to the remoteness of the region that begins from Matayan Drass, the east face of the summit is more challenging.
