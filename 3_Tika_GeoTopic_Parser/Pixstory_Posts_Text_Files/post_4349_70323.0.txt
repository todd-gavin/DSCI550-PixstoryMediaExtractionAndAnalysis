Ending frenzied speculation that had recently gained momentum over the constituency from which Yogi Adityanath will seek election to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the BJP on Sunday (January 15) finally declared the chief minister’s candidacy from his home turf of Gorakhpur Urban, besides releasing the first list of 107 candidates for the poll-bound state.

The party’s decision to field Adityanath, Mahant of the Gorakhnath Mandir, from his bastion came amid rumours that he may contest the polls from a constituency in Ayodhya, Mathura or even Varanasi.

As soon as the BJP made its list of candidates public, a seemingly orchestrated campaign began from a section of the media on the “bold move” the party made by fielding the CM from his home turf.

There were commentaries aplenty on how Adityanath, the BJP’s controversial and feisty hardline Hindutva mascot in UP, had decided to bite the proverbial bullet and face the hustings in Gorakhpur despite the possibility of a “tough electoral contest” with a resurgent Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party.

Breathless mentions were also made on the shock defeat the BJP had suffered in 2018 when it lost the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat to the SP in a by-election necessitated by Adityanath’s appointment as UP CM.

Adityanath had represented the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat for five consecutive terms since 1998, taking over from his guru, the late Mahant Avaidhyanath, former Mahant of the Gorakhnath Mandir.

To many within the BJP ecosystem and beyond, Adityanath was always a ‘natural choice’ to contest the Gorakhpur Urban seat ever since he declared his intention of contesting the upcoming polls instead of bypassing the poll process by continuing as a member of the UP Legislative Council. So why then were there hectic rumours of the BJP contemplating to field the saffron-clad CM from some other constituency?
