Even though cancel culture has its demerits it is a powerful tool. Cancel culture gives a voice to disenfranchised or less powerful people. It is the voice of the suppressed that emerges and gets a platform through this culture.

‌Callout culture is simply a new form of boycott, a tactic in the civil rights movement, to bring about social change. We boycott them so that it's our choice to choose what we want. It doesn't need to be a form of cyber abuse. It could be simply unfollowing them on their social media handles. If you can’t stop something through political means, what you can do is dismiss them.

If a platform doesn't respect our privacy we could boycott it. It gives us an option to respond to the deeds that somebody or something did to us.
