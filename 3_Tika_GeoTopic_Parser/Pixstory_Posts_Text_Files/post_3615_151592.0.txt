Kennedy passed away last October.In 2005, Wieden was appointed as the chairman of Wieden+Kennedy.Wieden+Kennedy is known for its offbeat work culture in the advertising sector. The company is renowned for seeking out distinct viewpoints and also hiring individuals with backgrounds outside of traditional advertising.According to reports, Matt O'Rourke, a former creative director at the company said, Wieden once explained that strategy by posing the question, "Why would I hire ad people?"To guarantee Wieden+Kennedy would continue to be independent indefinitely, Wieden had famously declared that he would never sell the agency and had transferred ownership into a trust before he passed away, as per reports.
