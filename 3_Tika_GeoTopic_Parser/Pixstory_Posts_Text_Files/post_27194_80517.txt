Another piece of Milanese history that is gone another place of culture forced to close This time it&#39;s the turn of the historic theater in the center of Milan, the Arlecchino cinema One of the last bulwarks of the old tradition of single screen cinemas in city centers unfortunately it collapsed by definitively lowering the shutters The elegant monosola located in via San Pietro all Orto cross Corso Vittorio Emanuele was a place of rare beauty inside there was even a mosaic and ceramic sculpture of Harlequin created by the famous Lucio Fontana The closure of the Arlecchino cinema followed in the footsteps of the old Apollo Spazio Cinema now in the city center only the Odeon remains even if it will soon be completed
