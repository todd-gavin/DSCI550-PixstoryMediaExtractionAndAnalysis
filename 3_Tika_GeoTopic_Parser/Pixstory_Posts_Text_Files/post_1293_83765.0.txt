The American F1 team, Haas F1, has already removed ‘Uralkali’ from their title sponsorship. URALKALI is a Russian Chemical company owned by Oligarch Dmitri Mazepin. Mazepin is known to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It is because of the URALKALI sponsorship that his son Nikita Mazepin has been able to drive in F1. With the recent violence that Russia has unleashed on Ukraine, F1 has decided to cancel this year’s race in Russia. 

Now that the future of URALKALI is in question as the title sponsor of Haas, so is the seat of driver Nikita Mazepin in F1. Haas Team Principal Guenther Steiner has also said that the future of the association of URALKALI with Haas is uncertain. Thus, Nikita’s drive as well. 

With that being said, whispers around the paddock are being reportedly heard that Former Alfa Romeo driver Antonio Giovinazzi’s name is at the top of the list for a possible replacement. The Italian driver drove in F1 from 2019 to 2021, after which he was unable to hold onto his seat because of inconsistent performance and lack of sponsorship money. His seat has been taken this year by the Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou.

Giovinazzi is part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. Given the close relationship between Ferrari and Haas, it seems believable that this might actually happen if Nikita Mazepin loses his paid seat. Antonio currently drives for the Dragon Penkse team in Formula E.

Other names which are popping up are Pietro Fittipaldi (Reserve driver for Haas), and Robert Schwartzman. Schwartzman is also Russian but not a pay driver. He is part of the Ferrari Driver Academy as well and is a promising young driver.
