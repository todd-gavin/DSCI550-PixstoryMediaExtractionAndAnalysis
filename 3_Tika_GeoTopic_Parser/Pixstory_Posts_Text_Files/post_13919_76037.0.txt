Roy Hodgson is set to take over the reigns as the manager of Watford Football Club after the club sacked Claudio Ranieri after just three-and-a-half months incharge. 

Ranieri was incharge of The Hornets for just 12 games. During his short stint, Watford managed just two wins, losing nine games. 

The Pozzo family who run the club will be making their 15th managerial appointment in less than years. They have a reputation of being impatient owners, a reputation well displayed by their long list of sackings. 

Hodgson has been in similar situations in the past, helping teams battle relegation and keeping them up. Watford find themselves second from bottom in the Premier League standings, just two points above bottom placed Burnley, also their next opponent in the Premier League. 

Burnley have more than a couple games in hand over their relegation rivals, and Hodgson's first game in charge has all the makings of an exciting encounter to stay in the Premier League.
