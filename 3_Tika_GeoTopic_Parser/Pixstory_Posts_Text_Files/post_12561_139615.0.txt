Maybe you don't have attachment issues, maybe you're just a human who:

ğŸ’—Feels anxious when someone is frequently inconsistent, hot/cold 

ğŸ’—Is confused by mixed messages, lack of congruence between words + actions 

ğŸ’—Gets off balance by cycles of approach
and withdraw behaviors

ğŸ’—Experiences discomfort from limited

ğŸ’—Seeks clarity on where things stand and
where relationship may be headed

ğŸ’—Feels hurt by lack of reciprocity,
consideration

ğŸ’—Wants to communicate, instead of
constantly sweep things under the rug

Someone who resonates with these emotions, I can definitely support and understand everyone going through this. Understanding and retrospecting is a blissful process and should be considered by all.
