Justin Thomas wants to do homage to the game's spirit. 

A hefty wedge from a difficult lie and a big fat bogey on the scorecard were his rewards. 

US News reported that on Saturday, the PGA champion's drive on the fourth hole at The Country Club landed awkwardly next to a drain in the fairway. Thomas requested a ruling, but admitted to the official that the drain did not obstruct his swing; if he had stated that it did, he would have been entitled to free relief. 

Thomas had to reach over the drain and bend down to make contact since he was forced to play the ball as it lay. He smacked the ball into a bunker just short of the green.

On-course microphones caught Thomas saying he was annoyed “because so many other people would lie about being able to hit that. But it’s just like, ‘I’m not going to hit it.’”

If a player claims a drain or other “abnormal course condition” would have interfered with the swing they intended to make, they would be allowed free relief under the rules. But Thomas conceded that he couldn’t honestly claim that.

“In the spirit of the game, I wasn’t going to hit the drain,” he said after the round. “I felt like I very easily could have told her that I was going to and gotten a free drop, but I wasn’t.”
