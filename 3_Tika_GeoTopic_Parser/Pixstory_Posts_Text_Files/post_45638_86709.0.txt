The 660' project, also known as The Driver, is produced by AMC Studios in collaboration with A+E Studios and Thruline Entertainment. It stars Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul). The first season is set to premiere in 2023 on AMC+ and AMC. 

Sunu Gonera (Class of 09) and Danny Brocklehurst (The Stranger) devised the adaption, which follows a cab driver whose life is flipped upside down when he decides to chauffeur a New Orleans-based Zimbabwean mobster who is known for exploiting illegal immigrants at US southern ports. Brocklehurst and Jim Poyser designed the project's original three-part iteration. 

C21 Media reported that the showrunner will be Theo Travers (Billions), and the pilot will be directed by Gonera. 

The role marks a return to AMC for Chilean-American Esposito to AMC where he played his most memorable character – narcotics distributor Gus Fring – in both Breaking Bad and prequel series Better Call Saul.

“We are excited to be continuing his relationship with AMC and AMC+ in a series built around him and an unforgettable character who takes what he thinks is a straightforward job opportunity and finds himself confronted with a world that tests him in ways he could never have imagined,” said Dan McDermott, president of entertainment and AMC Studios for AMC Networks.

Along with Thruline's Josh Kesselman and Danny Sherman, and A+E Studios' Jossen and Jamieson, Esposito, Gonera, Brocklehurst, and Travers will executive produce. 

Isle of the Dead, Demascus, and Invitation to a Bonfire are among the recent greenlights for AMC and AMC+'s 2023 calendar.
