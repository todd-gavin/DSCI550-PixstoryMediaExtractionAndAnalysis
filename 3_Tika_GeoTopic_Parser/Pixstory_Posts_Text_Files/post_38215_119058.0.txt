Harry Maguire has suffered a torrid time at Manchester United last season. The defender was heckled by fans and pundits for his lesser-than-average performances. But the center-back has reportedly chosen to stay put rather than moving to Barcelona this summer! 

As per Stretty News, "Barcelona had asked for Maguire as part of their negotiations for De Jong, with United immediately shutting that proposal down. Now, in a fresh update, it has been claimed that Maguire was completely unmoved by Barcelona’s interest, with the United skipper steadfast in his desire to stay at the club.

The report continues to state that Maguire is determined to overcome his difficult patch at the club and has been encouraged by the trust shown in him by Erik ten Hag. With the 2022 FIFA World Cup just around the corner, Harry Maguire would know that he is an important commodity for England in the lead-up to the global event. However, his recent form would surely be a concern for the England manager Gareth Southgate. 

Nevertheless, Maguire has been seen working hard this preseason with his Manchester United teammates. The defender also received a positive note of value from the manager as Erik Ten Hag confirmed that Maguire would remain his captain after early speculation over whether the Dutchman would choose another skipper.

It has to be seen if Harry Maguire can rediscover his form as he leads Manchester United once again next season!
