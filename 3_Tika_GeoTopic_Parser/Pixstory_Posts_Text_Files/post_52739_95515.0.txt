Masks  have  become a habitual part of our life since the inception of Covid-19 pandemic, I believe that even after one is fully vaccinated or covid -19 protocols are not mendatory we should  follow up some precautions for our own well being. 
Wearing a mask costs us nothing as we have developed cloth masks which could be easily stiched in home , but not wearing can sometimes make us fall sick due to tramission of virues from the people around us, so when in crowded areas, or in public places mask should be worn for our own safety. 
Secondly, the air around is so polluated that it can itself cause harm to us when we breathe so wearing mask can also help protect us to an extent from air borne diseases. 
Lastly, we are so accustomed to wearing a mask from past 2 years that wearing it even for longer won't harm us in any way. 
But the only thing to be taken care of should be that the mask should be neat and clean.
