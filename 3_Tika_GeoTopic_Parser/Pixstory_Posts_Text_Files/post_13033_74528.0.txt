You do not shoot at us, you at our neighbor
To this depressed heart of sorrow,
Do not shoot this broken heart of your war
The pages of our lives are full of national, ethnic, religious and terrorist wars
Death has become a normal thing, the nation is so carefree that we are being sacrificed in the most heinous way, and its revenge is a proclamation, a national mourning.
One wonders what to do when repetitive human crimes happen every day
We die for the dream and wish for peace, we become your victims, O savage Talib
From what sorrow should I say from yesterday or today, from last year or this year

From immigration or child play, from wasted children or from rape, from fortune-telling or backwardness
In what language should I say, we are in pain, let us live, let us breathe
