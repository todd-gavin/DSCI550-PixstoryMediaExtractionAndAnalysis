The Los Angeles Lakers made a pair of roster moves on Monday and while much of the attention went towards the signing of veteran point guard D J Augustin the franchise also made a very intriguing move with the signing of Wenyen Gabriel to a two way contract Gabriel is an extremely athletic forward who has bounced around the NBA over the past couple of seasons He had stints in New Orleans Portland and Sacramento in and and this season has appeared in a handful of games with the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Clippers The Lakers have had some success with their two way players showing the ability to develop players into rotation pieces and head coach Frank Vogel made it clear that Gabriel is someone the franchise has high hopes for Wenyen Gabriel is someone that we have been high on Vogel said Someone we believe has upside as a really athletic and D type player Gabriel s potential as a defender is extremely high given his physical attributes and high motor In some ways he is similar to Stanley Johnson who earned himself a contract with the Lakers after originally signing a day contract Normally players on a two way contract split their time between the G League and the main roster but Vogel doesn t expect that to be the case for Gabriel My understanding is that he will be with us full time not really with the G League unless there are smaller stints that require that Vogel added We will give him a look Hopefully we can get some practice time We can see him and see what he can do up close in person He has a skill set that fits what we need The successful stints have been with Bron Russ and AD and the younger energetic guys We ll have to see what Wenyen brings to the table but it is possible that he get in the rotation Any player who brings energy and effort on the defensive end of the floor is always someone who appeals to Vogel
