Black crop top, blue ripped denims and white sneakers!! 🫶🥵I think black can be paired up with all the colours but looks best with blue denim i believe. 🥳This is my go to outfit when i’m not sure what to wear , the combination is just so effortless and always looks so good.Blue ripped denims is a must in everybody’s closet and ofcourse white sneaker too!! 👟 I can honestly wear black color all my life and not get bored. 😵‍💫🫠 Share you favourite outfit color combination in the notes. ☺️
