Former Real Madrid captain Marcelo Vieira has signed for Greek football club¬† Olympiacos on a one-year contract. 
The 33-year-old brazilian has been club-less since leaving the reigning European champions in July this year.
Marcelo has now joined the 47-time Greek champions and has the chance to extend his deal for a further one year if he wishes. 
Marcelo ended his 2 decade journey with Madrid in fairytale circumstances when he helped Real Madrid to win the UEFA Champions League last season.
His most-recent trophy tilt back in May took his total title haul at Madrid to 25, making him the most decorated player in the history of the club.
Marcelo signed for the reigning European and La Liga champions from Brazilian side Fluminense in 2007, making a staggering 546 appearances at the Santiago Bernabeu. 
He featured 58 times for the Brazil's senior national team after playing his first international match in 2006. 
Marcelo's new team, Olympiacos, are currently placed third on the Greek Super League log after two games this season.
A very good bye to the exceptional Legend, What a beautiful journey it was with Real Madrid. I hope him the best future with his new club ‚ù§
We Madrid fans will miss him üòì
Thankyou ‚öΩ
