The metal scene in India is not as young as people believe going back all the way to the s with Millenium though let s be honest the whole scene has never been popular or supported here in India or in the subcontinent Even today it is not supported and largely looked down upon as an untamed and crass form of music As times have passed we have more and more upcoming bands and the scene has transitioned from lame and dull to something really interesting Why lame and dull Because a bunch of Indian metal bands that started hitting the scene early were more like crappy Cannibal Corpse or Metallica rip offs offering nothing of substance Nonetheless things have been changing These days Indian bands have started becoming more ingenious whether it is going old school or doing their own thing in terms of content they are far from lacking and are all around awesome I remember always regretting that India did not have much of a metal scene Well what a tight slap in the face the scene has more than plenty to offer and while there is plenty of room to grow the Indian metal scene is not some vacant space anymore it is alive and trying to grow Now even though the scene has grown a lot over the years it still lacks public support funds or mainstream interest And if metal in India could just gain a more favourable reputation it could really grow and we can have even more ass kicking bands rip up the international stage Though with the way things are the scene has gained a good level of traction over the years and there are bands out there that are one mighty force to reckon with While they don t have the same level of fame they easily rival the best of the best coming from the West these days Don t believe me These are some of the best metal bands in India people should check out Kryptos Demonic Resurrection Bloodywood Undying Inc Skyharbor The Down Troddence Lucid Recess Alien Gods Against Evil Inner Sanctum
