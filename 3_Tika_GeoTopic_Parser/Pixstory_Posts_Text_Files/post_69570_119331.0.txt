Pari Mahal, also known locally as Peer Mahal or the "Palace of the Fairies," was constructed in the middle of the sixteenth century as a library for Dara Shikoh, Shah Jahan's eldest son. Pari Mahal is a seven-terraced garden that is stashed in the lap of the Zabarwan mountain range and is situated southwest of Dal Lake. 
It was constructed under the rule of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and is the epitome of Mughal architecture. This historical monument site is well-known for its exotic fruit orchards, vibrant flowers, and lush vegetation.
It also served as Prince Dara Shikoh's astrology and astronomy school. The Buddhist Monastery is reported to have been founded at the same area where Pari Mahal now stands. The monastery's remains are where the Pari Mahal is now located. The Pari Mahal provides a beautiful perspective of the surroundings with the towering Himalayas in the background and Dal Lake in the front.
