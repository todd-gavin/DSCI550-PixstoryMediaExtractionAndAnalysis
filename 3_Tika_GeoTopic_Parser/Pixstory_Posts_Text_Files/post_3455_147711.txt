I started seeing them from a more wholesome lens be it the upright fearless Bishan Bedi the matchless Viv Richards and a whole range of champions gaining new perspectives on the greats be it Kapil Dev or Gavaskar Tendulkar or Dravid This understanding helped me give a more humane dimension to the narrative in the book I would say that writing my memoir was a dynamic process The book isn t about me It juxtaposes my life with several other people I have interacted with their perceptions learning and actions And when you write about others your own biases and judgements creep in Objectivity is elusive it s a mirage Yet I tried my best to not get close to any player or an official so that I could write my reports as fearlessly as possible I know it wasn t an easy task but I would like to believe that my work ethic has given me the advantage of being an independent observer When you are reporting it s easy to be selective you make a judgement because you have to choose between two sides But if you focus on what compels those actions of individuals what led them to behave in a certain way in a given situation it helps in comprehending their actions without being too judgmental It all narrows down to how you explain a circumstance Instead of denouncing a player or giving a favourable opinion it is better to explain the action on the field as it happened For that you have to be very good with the technical aspects of the sport you are writing about Judgement if any should be subtly hidden in the style of your writings As told to Sanya Tyagi To be continued To get the book please visit NOT JUST CRICKET A Reporter s Journey through Modern India
