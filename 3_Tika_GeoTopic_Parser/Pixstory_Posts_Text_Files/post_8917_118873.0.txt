Chief Justice of India continues....

My tenure of office as Chief Justice terminated on 23rd December 1954. On its termination, Mr. Justice Mukerjee the Chief Justice designate, referred to my work on the bench at the farewell dinner given by the judges of the Supreme Court and attended by the President, Among other things he said: “Gentlemen, It is my pleasure and privilege now to give you the toast of the Chief Justice of India. Chief Justice Mahajan will live long in the memory of those who know him as a sound lawyer, a talented judge, and efficient administrator and an extremely loveable person. 

He is one of the few people whose mind and heart are an open book to all. Blessed by nature with a strong constitution, he possess an equally vigorous intellect and a keen and alert mind that seldom flags. Generous, warm-hearted and literally beaming with the joy of life, he radiates round him a sunshine of goodwill and happiness. A natural urbanity of manners enables him to make and keep friends in different walks of life and his hospitality is almost proverbial. He is an ideal pater familias ruling over a family of sixteen children.

“Himself, a hard working man in a remarkable degree, Justice Mahajan had never any patience with the lazy and the pusillanimous in the legal profession and to them his utterances were seldom delectable. He is a firm believer in the freedom of thought and expression enshrined in our Constitution and he wants the judiciary to have the full measure of this freedom. 

That is why while hearing a case he would not maintain any degree of aloofness from the fight in which the legal combatants were engaged. 

He would throw himself into it with all the warmth and ardour of a fighter and give free expression to his views not merely on the merits of the case but about all men and things that might be in any way connected with it. His interjections were often too strong for junior members of the profession.
