On Tuesday Akhilesh Yadav, the Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister resigned as the Lok Sabha MP. Yadav has recently won from the Karhal seat in the recent 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. He is likely to continue as an MLA. Yadav had already hinted at this move saying that he was discussing with his close allies as wether he should continue as an MP or an MLA. Azam Khan who is another MP from the Samajwadi Party has also resigned from his post to continue as an MLA in Uttar Pradesh. The resignations from two top Samajwadi Party MPs come at a time when a new government is about to be formed in the state. These moves clearly suggest that the Samajwadi Party is clearly looking to focus on the next Assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh which are to be held in the year 2027. This move has been done so that the Samajwadi Party can do the ground work and build up its voter base before the 2027 Assembly elections. According to a political observer Akhilesh is keen to stay in Lucknow and is happy take the BJP head on in the Assembly and outside it as well. Until now Samajwadi Party had 5 MP's in the Lok Sabha and with Yadav's and Khan's resignation that number has now been reduced to just 3. Samajwadi Party is well aware of the limitations it has and has now decided to focus it energies at the state level rather the national level. According to sources the move of resigning from Lok Sabha was suggested to Akhilesh Yadav by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav who was the former chief of the Samajwadi Party.
