The “large puppy-dog eyes” emoji has several use cases . Some people use 🥺 to let others know they are upset or worried , and others use it to convey a sense of care . Whether you want to (virtually) give yourself a pat on the back or express support and adoration for someone else, the pleading face emoji is a strong option for social .
