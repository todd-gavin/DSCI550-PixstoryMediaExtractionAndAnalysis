Knowing your risk for rabies and what to do after coming into touch with animals can save lives. The best way to prevent rabies in the United States is to stay away from wildlife. Although any mammal can contract rabies, raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes are the most frequently affected animals in this country. All wildlife, especially injured animals, should be left alone. Don't handle an injured animal; instead, get in touch with the appropriate authorities to request help. Find out if rabies is present in dogs or wildlife at your location before travelling abroad because rabies in dogs is still widespread in many non-American nations. Preventing rabies in pets is especially important since they may contract the disease from wildlife and then spread it to people.Therefore,  preventing rabies in pets is also an important step in preventing human rabies cases.If you do come into contact with a rabid animal, rabies in humans is 100% preventable through prompt appropriate medical care. If you are bitten, scratched, or unsure, talk to a healthcare provider about whether you need PEP.Source: CDC
