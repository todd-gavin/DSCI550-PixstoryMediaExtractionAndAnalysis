Panic attacks can happen anytime, anywhere and when it happens at a public place it tends to be more distressing than at home, as at home people have more access to calming methods than in the public. 

There are few measures suggested by Dr. Kristin Bianchi, a psychologist at Maryland’s Center for Anxiety & Behavioral Change. And so if you are experiencing panic attacks in the public, you can take few of these measures. 

Keep a “calm down kit” in your bag or car 

If your aware that you could get more of panic attacks when you go outside be prepared with a small mobile kit. It could include items as followed: 

• smooth stones 

• essential oils 

• a beaded bracelet or necklace to touch 

• a small bottle of bubbles to blow 

Get yourself to a safe place 

Panic attack can make your body feel paralyzed, so it can be hard to get out of a crowd or to a safe, quite spot. So the best thing to do is to move your body to a place with relatively lower of free of noise and that has fewer stimuli than a crowded venue. 

Ask for help if you need it 

When you feel like the panic attack might be so severe, its absolutely fine to seek help. So when you ask for help let them know you are experiencing the attack so that they can do the neededful like checking the nearest medical facility, or getting a cab etc. 

Soothe yourself just as you would at home 

When you are in the public you can also go for your regular coping mechanisms like slowing down your breathing, bringing yourself into the present moment and so on. 

Stay where you are 

Instead of returning back home during the state of panic attack, you can engage yourself in any acts of self care that are available to you like drinking a warm beverage, meditating, taking a walk etc.
