Kenneth Branagh wrote and directed the movie Belfast He has done an amazing job to make this semi autobiographical film the movie depicts the s conflict in Northern Ireland from the perspective of his working class family during his childhood The movie features a stellar cast of Judi Dench Jamie Dornan Colin Morgan Caitriona Balfe and Jude Hill All of them have given wonderful perfomances under the direction of Kenneth Branagh The movie is a deeply personal story it shows a a conflict through the eyes of a child The director was nine years old when the conflict in Northern Ireland had begun and he had to leave his home The character of Buddy is a fictional version of Branagh s own childhood The director doesn t delve much into the poltics of the times because according to me he wanted to tell this tale from the perspective of Buddy and a nine year old boy wouldn t have a proper understanding of whats going on around him This is a memory movie with the mono chromes that it fills it feels like a memoir a nostalgic journey through anecdotes Kenneth Branagh tells a very poignant story which he keeps a hold of at all times The movie is brilliant in every sense and Branagh might just take the Oscar home
