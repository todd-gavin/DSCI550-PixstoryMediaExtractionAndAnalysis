A video of a protest march in Kerala is viral with the claim that it is of Muslims opposing the appointment of the new “Brahmin” district collector of Alappuzha. It is also viral with the claim that the place of the protest seen in the clip is Alleppey, Kerala.

The official page of the right-wing Hindu nationalist party Indu Makkal Katchi shared this video with the caption “In Allepy Kerala ystrday (yesterday), Muslims opposing the new Brahmin IAS collector, took out a procession, MSM cunningly avoided this and highlighted ABVP in Karnataka.” (Archived link) The tweet garnered almost 7.5k likes and 5000 retweets.

Twitter user Indian_Analyzer also tweeted the video.

Without making any direct claims, BJP leader Kapil Mishra tweeted about this protest saying “it is a threat to national unity and integrity…”

Facebook page ‘Yogi AdityaNath The Future PM’ of India posted an image of the protest with the claim that they are protesting against the appointment of a Hindu IAS as Alappuzha’s collector.

Fact-Check
There were several comments that stated that the place seen in the video is Malappuram and not Alleppey as claimed by the viral posts. The comments also noted that the protest was against the appointment of IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman as the Alappuzha district collector as he was allegedly involved in a drunk-driving accident in the past that had resulted in the death of a journalist, thus refuting claims of a communal angle.

To probe further, we looked at The Hindu report dated June 08, 2020, which stated that Sriram Venkitaraman was arrested on charges of alcohol-impaired, reckless driving resulting in the death of journalist K. M. Basheer. He was charged under Section 279 (rash driving ) and 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC. He was later granted bail.
