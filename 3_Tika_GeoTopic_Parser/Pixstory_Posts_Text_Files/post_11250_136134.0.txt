How many of us have grown up seeing our parents eat a serving of papaya every day? Most of us, right? That fruit was a constant, while the others eaten during the course of a day would keep changing with the season. Papaya has been held in very high esteem, all thanks to the multiple benefits that it delivers.
1 It’s the perfect nutrition punch ;
Did you know that 150 gm of papaya will give you only 60 calories and that’s a steal for the nutrients it provides—fibre, potassium, and vitamins A, C, E, K and the B-family, including folate (vitamin B9)? It also provides minerals like magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, iron and manganese, as well as a number of phytochemicals, carotenoids and other antioxidant compounds that help prevent ageing and the onset of lifestyle diseases. It is one of the most nutritionally loaded foods around, per-calorie.
2 It has a low glycemic index ; 
It’s a safe food for diabetics in moderation because of its moderate glycemic index. This means it doesn’t lead to a sudden sugar rush. Plus, it’s good for the gut, rich in anti-oxidants, fibres and delivers multiple nutrients that help diabetics get their health quotient up.
3 Hearty power fruit ; 
The folate present in papaya helps control homocysteine in the bloodstream (a high level of homocysteine damages blood vessels and leads to heart disease), while the fibre in it inhibits the absorption of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Also, potassium — the legendary vasodilator — helps relieve the strain on the cardiovascular system by easing the tension in blood vessels and promoting better circulation, helping to keep blood pressure in check.
4 A good immunity booster ;
Vitamins A, C and E in papaya will keep your immune system really pumped up. It is a big help if one wants to keep recurring ear infections, colds and flus away.
