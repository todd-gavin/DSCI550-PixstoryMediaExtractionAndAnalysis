Aside from formal business attire, American fashion is eclectic and mostly casual. While clothing reflects Americans' diverse cultural roots, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy hats, boots, jeans, and leather motorcycle jackets are uniquely American styles. For the vast majority of Americans, casual is the preferred dress code even when dining out. Jeans are always popular and will serve as a versatile foundation for your wardrobe. Wear them with cool layers like camisoles or t-shirts in the summer, or warmer layers like a long-sleeved shirt and a thick sweater in the winter. The American clothing style is founded on three pillars: freedom of expression, comfort, and functionality. The desire to stand out and a disregard for other people's opinions coexist miraculously in the American way of dressing.
