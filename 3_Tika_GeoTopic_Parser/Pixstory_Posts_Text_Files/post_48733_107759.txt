First talks first A lot of men complain about wearing a condom for variety of reasons One it s uncomfortable Well that could be true but if you find your size as many men report you won t even feel it during sex In fact it s not the same as unprotected sex for women either but I guess we d rather have a little compromising here than getting pregnant or infected So do the research boys Another excuse they give is I don t fit which I say call bullsh t A condom could fit your whole feet Tell them to choose the correct size or no sex Receiving partners during sex whether anally or vaginally are more susceptible to a variety of STI diseases which is why a lot of men just don t care Patriarchy once again Men should be pleased even at the woman s cost According to one study percent of cis men and only percent of cis women orgasmed during their most recent sexual experience During partnered sexual activity of heterosexual men typically or always orgasm compared to only of heterosexual women It is also unrelated to their gender During sex at least percent of women in homosexual partnerships orgasm Total of about to of women have never had an orgasm and this data obviously excludes women who ve orgasmed by themselves and not with their male partner In bed many men are selfish lovers as evidenced by these statistics Why is that so Misinformation simply selfishness and especially conditioning They ve been taught for the longest time female satisfaction does not matter and it s not worth the time or that women can t orgasm which is simply untrue There s a percentage of women who can t but most women can and expecting them to sleep with you only so you can be satisfied and satisfying them is too much work is a jerk move What can be done Communication Communication is so SO important in sex From boundaries to pleasure you gotta start that Education Men learn how to have sex Seriously you need to Those stats are embarrassing And Respect Well duh
