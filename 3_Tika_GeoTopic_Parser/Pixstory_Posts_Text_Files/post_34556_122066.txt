Cristiano Ronaldo&#39;s future still a question mark Of course the new Ten Hag coach didn&#39;t take very well having left the stadium before the end of the Portuguese champion&#39;s match on Sunday afternoon Ronaldo was replaced at the end of the first half instead of waiting for the game to end admirable against Rayo Vallecano took a shower and went home while his teammates were still on the pitch The Dutch coach who arrived this year from Ajax defined Ronaldo&#39;s behavior as unacceptable we are a team and we all have to stay until the end And to think that the one against the Spanish team was the first outing of the season for the Ballon d&#39;Or winner I certainly won&#39;t accept this behaviour, added Ten Hag
