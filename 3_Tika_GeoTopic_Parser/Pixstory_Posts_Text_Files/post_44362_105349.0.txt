Champions Senegal will visit Rwanda at the Stade Me. Abdoulaye Wade in the second group stage fixture of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday.

Senegal come into the match winning their last match, while Rwanda will be looking to pick up the pace after drawing against Mozambique last time out. 

Rwanda almost took all three points last time out but were denied two minutes before time. They will be looking to put in a spirited performance in an incredibly difficult fixture. 

Senegal now have extended their form to 15 unbeaten in 16 games, and look unstoppable at the moment.
