There s a reason I chose a profile pic with a red panda I adore these beautiful creatures And as you woulf have it they re one of the most fascinating animals as well For example unlike what their name suggests red pandas are not closely related to giant pandas In order to avoid predators and sleep red pandas prefer to hang out in trees Oh and they enjoy a good sunbathe up there They actually get clinically depresses if they don t have trees to climb around them They love their habitat which is one of the reasons they re threatened by the constant deforestation by humans As far as is known they are the only non primate species that can taste aspartame which means they love eating artificial sweeteners Red pandas can descend trees head first thanks to their rotating ankles and false thumb They are not only one of the most exquisite creatures on our planet but also the only species of its type and they are members of the Ailuridae family of the genus Ailurus Unfortunately these interesting animals are critically endangered In India Bhutan China Nepal and Myanmar red pandas are lawfully protected due to their endangered status Our interference with them is a major reason From habitat loss and degradation to illegal poaching we ve made sure to make it as difficult for them to live as we can
