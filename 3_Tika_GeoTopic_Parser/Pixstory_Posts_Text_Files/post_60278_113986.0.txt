Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and RCP Singh left their positions in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Both ministers resigned in order to comply with the constitution because their terms as Rajya Sabha MPs were slated to expire and they would no longer be members of parliament.

Singh served as the Modi administration's minister of steel, and Naqvi oversaw the ministry responsible for minorities. Two Cabinets

Naqvi and Singh received praise from PM Modi for their services to the advancement of the nation.
The fact that Modi expressed gratitude was interpreted as a sign that this was the ministers' final Cabinet meeting.

Naqvi met JP Nadda, the president of the BJP at the national level, shortly after the Cabinet meeting.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may nominate Naqvi for the position of governor or lieutenant governor of a state or Union Territory or as its vice presidential candidate for the elections in August.
