Austria's parliament on Thursday passed a bill making Covid-19 vaccines compulsory for all residents age 18 and older starting on Feb. 1.

It is the first country in the European Union to impose such a strict measure.  

While the mandate goes into effect Feb. 1, Austrian officials will only begin conducting checks to see if the law is being adhered to starting on March 15. From then, those without a vaccine certificate or an exemption could be slapped with initial fines of 600 euros (around $680) going up to 3,600 euros (around $4,080).  

According to the Austrian Health Ministry's website, pregnant people and those who cannot be vaccinated without endangering their health are exempt from the law. People who are recovering from a Covid-19 infection are also exempt for 180 days from the date they received their first positive PCR Covid-19 test.

In addition to the introduction of the vaccine mandate, the Austrian government said Thursday that it was introducing a national lottery to encourage those unsure of getting a Covid-19 vaccine to get vaccinated, and those who have already been vaccinated twice to receive a booster shot.    

"To put it bluntly, we have earmarked up to 1 billion euros for the vaccination lottery, which is based on reward and incentive,'' Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said at a news conference hours before the vote in parliament. "I believe it's totally justified to spend this money."  

Nehammer said that Austrian citizens will get one lottery ticket for each vaccine shot they have had, meaning three tickets in total for those who have had their booster shot. The lottery entails that every 10th ticket would win a gift voucher of 500 euros (about $568), the Austrian chancellor said.  

Nehammer said that Austria has learned from its past successes, adding ''we have seen that a vaccination lottery is the best possible way to set up such a system.‚Äù
