 Over washing your hair Washing your hair too often can strip the natural oils from your hair which can lead to dryness and damage Try washing your hair once every two to three days or use a gentle shampoo that focuses on delicate areas like the scalp Using harsh chemicals or sulfates in your shampoo Sulfates are harsh chemicals that can damage the hair and scalp as well as cause scalp irritation and dandruff Look for shampoos that contain biochemicals instead of sulfates or choose a brand that specifically targets curly or frizzy hair textures Not conditioning your hair properly Conditioning the hair keeps it hydrated and helps to prevented breakage and damage Apply conditioner before you shower every day and after you towel dry your head Failing to seal the cuticles of your Hair with a good sealant This will stop moisture from escaping the strands helping them stay healthy and looking their best for longer periods of time Using heating tools too frequently Hot tools can heat up the scalp and cause inflammation and pain which is never a good thing when it comes to hairstyling products Stick to using heat only when necessary usually only when you re straightening or curling your locks Skipping the shampoo This is one of the most common hair care mistakes that people make Not washing your hair properly leaves it dry and brittle which can lead to breakage and damage Using too much shampoo Shampooing too much can actually strip your hair of its natural oils which is why it s important to use a pea sized amount every time you wash it
