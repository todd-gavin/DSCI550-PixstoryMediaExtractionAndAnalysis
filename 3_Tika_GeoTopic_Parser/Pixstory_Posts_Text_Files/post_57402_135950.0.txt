ADHD and ODD can occur together.
This is because when ODD symptoms like defiance and aggressive behaviour are mixed with ADHD issues like lack of focus, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, the behaviours can build on one another and become potent. 
Some common risk factors of ODD and ADHD are genetics, learned behaviours, psychological issues,  development issues your child may have when they’re toddlers, and problems with home life.
The two conditions may appear similar because some of the symptoms can overlap. But the causes are usually different. For example, ADHD is primarily a genetic condition and is often passed down by family members. As a result, kids with ADHD find it difficult to control their behaviour.
