Recently I had the opportunity to visit this nursery growing a diverse range of plants and flowers I loved the air quality and even though the weather was hot and humid the area around the nursery was cool and provided some much needed relief There were many seasonal plants and flowers and I especially loved some of the hybrids and grafted plants The nursery was also cultivating many fruit trees and herbs I have shared the pictures of some of the blossoms that I personally loved Safe to say I had a great time and brought some amazing plants home
