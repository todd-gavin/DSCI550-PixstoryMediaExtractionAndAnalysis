 The specific type of CO that is increasing in the earth s atmosphere can be directly connected to human activity We can identify this by looking at the specific isotopes In objection that this is a natural process let s not see the fact that average temperatures on earth have heightened at a rate far faster than can be explained by natural climate changes We cannot blame the sun for global warming as there has been a huge increase in global temperatures that is too large to associate with the sun This is why NASA and other scientists say the sun is not responsible for global warming The damage is very much real Global warming affected by human produced greenhouse gases is causing the Arctic ice cap to melt at an increasing rate As the Arctic ice cover proceeds to decrease the amount of the sun s heat reflected by the ice back into space also decreases Hence creating a loop that amplifies global warming Even sea levels are rising due to the next level of melting from polar ice caps Ocean acidity levels are increasing at an unprecedented rate that can only be explained by human activity The excess Co is even absorbed in the water The US Government Accountability Office GAO said oceans have assimilated about of the CO emitted by humans over the past years and ocean acidity could rise approximately per cent than the pre industrial days In addition human caused global warming is altering weather systems and making heat waves and droughts more intense and more frequent We all the change is happening solely due to our carelessness There is no other planet right now to go and save ourselves So better to protect our planet
