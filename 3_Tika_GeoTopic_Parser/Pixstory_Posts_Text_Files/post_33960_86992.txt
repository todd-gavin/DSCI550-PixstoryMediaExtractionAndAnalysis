A defeat at San Siro against Milan which, however, does not tarnish the good things Andreazzoli&#39;s Empoli has done so far. Last Sunday it was a football match in costume rather than played and we adapted. most important in the championship and you can&#39;t have chances like in the first leg Tonight I liked what little we did in attack To score goals you also need a little bit of luck but this time too Maignan surpassed himself Thanks to him but not ours we looked for the solution but it didn&#39;t go well It&#39;s true that we&#39;ve fallen a bit in the conclusions on goal we&#39;re not collecting much A lot of work to do especially when the team has no experience in the category We started from complete strangers and you have to give a certain way of interpreting things And it&#39;s a daily job that you can never abandon the boys immediately realize if you want to pass on or are they cliches If you put yourself in a position to be so they&#39;ll follow you The satisfaction that we have players who can all play and we change them every Sunday because they all respond in the right way
