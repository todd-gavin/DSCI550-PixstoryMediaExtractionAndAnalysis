On June 6, in an interview given to ANI, the founder of Isha Foundation Jaggi Vasudev, better known as ‘Sadhguru’, claimed that India has not witnessed “major” communal violence in the past 5-6 years or 10 years.

Sadhguru is on a worldwide tour where he is allegedly covering 18,000 miles across Europe, the Middle East and India on his motorbike to “raise awareness” about soil. On Monday, in an interview given to ANI’s Smita Prakash, Sadhguru was asked about the rising religious intolerance in the country, to which he replied, “I think we tend to exaggerate things quite a bit. Yes, there are a few issues which have come to debate and there’s a lot of heat on the television channels, you don’t see that anywhere on the street, all right. You walk across Delhi you walk across any village in the country, there is no such intolerance or such violence or anything… [sic]”

He further goes on to say, “25 years ago when we were in university there was not a single year when there was no major communal riot in the country. Every year there used to be somewhere… major… we have not heard of such things in the last five-six years at least or maybe ten years we have not heard of such things here and there some flash points have happened, unfortunately… [sic]”

Analysis of the comment
Smita Prakash’s question to Sadhguru was about the rising religious intolerance in the country, however, it seems Sadhguru’s understanding of intolerance means conflicts that end up becoming large-scale communal violence. Intolerance does not necessarily mean that it has to turn into communal violence that results in a large number of deaths. It can be attributed to everyday instances that regress individual freedom, further alienate religious minorities, raise the number of hate crimes, hate speeches, and much more.
